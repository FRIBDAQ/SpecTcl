/*!
   The CHistogrammerFitObserver class is an observer that the
   CHistogrammer class/object registers to monitor changes in the
   fit dictionary.  As this class is a subclass of CFitDictionary::CObserver,
   the key members called are:
   - Add  - Called when a new fit is added to the dictionary.
   - Delete - Called when an existing fit is about to be deleted from the dictionary
   - Update - Called when  a fit has been asked to update its parameters based
              on the current spectrum values.

   CHistgrammer uses this to update fits on spectra bound to Xamine.
   Ensuring the appropriate fits are visible on Xamine's bound spectra.
