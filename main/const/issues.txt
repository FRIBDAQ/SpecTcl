Issues:
- ConstProcessor never registered
   resolved: Register and push to end of pipeline at each parameter def.

- Blows up if I define a constparam.
    resolved: Actually error in strip chart spectrum did not require
    presence of all parameters.

- Or list does not appear empty when processing data.
    resolved: Mis handled increment.
- Strip chart spectrum seems to not have a good initial offset?
    resolved:  Mis handled shifts larger than spectrum width.
