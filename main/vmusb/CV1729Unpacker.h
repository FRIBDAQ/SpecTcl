/*!
  This unpacker is responsible for unpacking 
  data from CAEN V1729 FADC waveform digitizers.
  Each defined channel is mapped to a set of pre-created
  2k spectra.  waveforms get put into each spectrum until all spectra
  are used up at which point the spectra are all cleared and our antics start
  all over again.  The slot in the parameterm ap that's normally reserved for a virtual slot
  instead contains the mask of channels in use by this module.
 
  A current restriction is that the number of columns read is always 256.
