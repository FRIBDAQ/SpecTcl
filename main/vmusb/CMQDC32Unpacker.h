/*!
   This module is responsible for unpacking the Mesytec MQDC-32 32 channel QDC.
   These modules have a virtual slot number.  It is therefore possible to 
   to do perfect matching on the data stream.. and to deal with complete supression
   of the module in the data stream.

   One wrinkle is that the module actually recognized 33 channels.  Channel 0-31
   are the conversions of the various channels of the ADC module.  Channel 32 is
   the timestamp/event-number.

   this allows the user to create strip charts of something vs time (e.g. counts of
   hits in some place)
