    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
        This book is intended to cover several topics people programming
        within the SpecTcl histogramming framework might need.  The intended audience
        are those who might be tailoring SpecTcl to analyze the data from a
        specific experiment from the NSCLDAQ as well as those who may want to
        go further.  This guide is intended to be used in conjunction with the
        programming reference manual which provides detailed class reference
        information for the key classes.

                    be covered in a bit greater detail than in the user guide.
                    Understanding this model, and where to attach your code
                    to it can be important to following the path of least resistance
                    in accomplishing your programming goals.

                    The event processing pipeline is the set of objects that
                    transform raw events into parameters that SpecTcl processes.
                    We'll take a look at this and describe how to write event
                    process pipeline elements as well as how to prepare SpecTcl
                    to anlyze filtered data.  Along the way the SpecTclAPI object
                    will be introduced.  It provides stable interfaces to several
                    important subsystems of SpecTcl

                    The event sink pipeline takes over where the event
                    processing pipeline leaves off.  It performs all processing
                    on the unpacked event.  The built in processing includes
                    Histograming and processing any filters that are active.
                    You can, however, hook your own code to the event sink
                    pipeline.

                    SpecTcl uses the Tcl scripting language as its base command
                    language.  There are cases where adding a compiled command
                    to SpecTcl is useful.  This chapter introduces the
                    Tcl++ C++ wrapping of the Tcl interpreter and how to use
                    it to add commands and interface with other interpreter
                    elements.

        The SpecTcl processing model.    
    </title>
    <para>
        This chapter describes the SpecTcl processing model.  In order to
        effectively write SpecTcl based software it is important to have some
        understanding of how SpecTcl organizes its computing.  The intent of this
        chapter is to provide an overview of this processing model.  Each of the
        remaining chapters in this book will then zoom in on one section of
        that model and describe how to write software that extends or lives inside
        of that section.
    </para>
    <para>
        The figure below graphically shows the major components of SpecTcl
        and their main interactions.

    </figure>
    <para>
        The core of SpecTcl is a command interpreter that is an extended
        version of the Tcl/Tk scripting language (<ulink url='http://www.tcl.tk' />).
        Tcl is a general purpose programming language with a very simple syntax.
        You can learn most of what you need about Tcl in under an hour.  The Tk
        toolkit bolts on to Tcl providing a mechanism for Tcl scripts to create
        rich graphical user interfaces.
    </para>
    <para>
        SpecTcl extents the Tcl interpreter.  It adds commands to the interpreter
        that provide the ability to create and manipulate the objects SpecTcl
        needs.  The most prominent of these objects are parameters, spectra, gates
        and gate applications.  Parameters, spectra and gates are held in
        dictionaries indexed by their names.  Gate applications are stored
        with their spectra.
    </para>
    <para>
        Tcl/Tk's processing model provides an event loop.  An event loop
        reacts to events and dispatches them to appropriate handlers.
        SpecTcl's Tcl extensions establish a source of events.  When the data
        source has data avaialable, the event loop dispatches it to a processing
        pipeline.
    </para>
    <para>
        The first stage of event processing knows about the high level format of
        the data. This is used to unpack blocks of data into units that consist
        of, among other things events.  This is represented by the diagram's
        <literal>High level parsing</literal>  box.  In most cases
        you will not need to provide or modify that code.  That code only needs
        to be touched if you are adapting SpecTcl to data from a new data acquisition
        system not supported by SpecTcl.
    </para>
    <para>
        The high data parsing stage locates blocks of events (a block may be
        a single event long as it is for ring buffer data).  Events from
        this block are passed one by one to the event processing pipeline.
    </para>
    <para>
        The event processing pipeline is the code you will normally have to write.
        It takes a raw event and extracts meaningful parameters from it.
        The format of a raw event and the definition of meaningful parameter
        are both experiment specific.  
    </para>
    <para>
        The event processing pipeline consists of an arbitrary number of stages.
        Each stage has access to the raw event and to the parameters that have
        been unpacked from it by the prior stages.  Careful organization of
        the functionality of your event processors can be key both to allowing
        your detector system to be easily reconfigured and to layering the extraction
        of computed parameters on top of raw parameters in a meaningful and organized
        way.
    </para>
    <para>
        The parameters produced by the event processing pipeline are then passed
        to the event sink pipeline.  The main component of that is the
        histogramming kernel.  It uses the parameters, parameter definitions,
        spectrum definitions, gate applications and relevant gate definitions
        to determine which histograms will be incremented and where.
    </para>
    <para>
        At this point, the only other elements that live in the event sink
        pipeline are filters.  Filters produce a reduced data set by outputing
        some set of parameters for events that satisfy a gate.  It is very
        unusual for application specific code to need to add elements to the
        event sink pipeline, though that is  possible.
    </para>
    <para>
        Histograms are stored by SpecTcl as arrays of data with descriptive
        metadata.  SpecTcl has no built in visualization component.  It can
        store spectrum bulk data in a shared  memory region and supports a few
        well defined communications mechanisms that allow external displayers
        to let you visualize and interact with the data.  The two visualizers
        that are currently supported are Xamine and Spectra.  Xamine is an
        X-11/Motif application, while spectra is based on Root
        (<ulink url='http://root.cern.ch' />).
    </para>
    <para>
        We won't say anything about Spectra in this document, however
        Xamine provides hooks to allow your code to interact with it and the
        data it displays.  We'll describe how to take advantage of those
        hooks.

        A simplified version of much of this material can be found in the
        SpecTcl user guide.  That document also describes how to modify the

        tailored SpecTcl executable.

    <para>
        The event processing pipeline is responsible for analyzing a raw
        event and turning it into a set of parameters that are passed to the
        event sink pipeline.  The histogrammer is one of the elements of the
        event sink pipeline.  To first order, you can view the purpose of
        the event analysis pipeline as preparing raw event data for histogramming.
    </para>
    <para>
        The event processing pipeline consists of an ordered set of
        <firstterm>Event processors</firstterm>.  Each event processor
        has access to the raw event as well as to the parameters that have
        been unpacked by prior elements of the pipeline.
    </para>
    <para>
        Event pipelines are usually defined statically at compilation time
        by registering the pipeline stages in the <methodname>CreateAnalysisPipeline</methodname>
        method of <filename>MySpecTclApp.cpp</filename>. The SpecTcl API also
        allows you to dynamically manipulate the pipeline.
    </para>
    <para>
        Due to the historical development of SpecTcl, there are two possible
        representation of parameters.  The first, and original/native version
        is as a flat array like object called a <classname>CEvent</classname>.
        A <classname>CEvent</classname> object is passed in to the
        each event processor.  It's a dynamically expanding array whose slots
        are <classname>ValidValue</classname> objects.  <classname>ValidValue</classname>
        objects are double precision real values that know when if they've been
        given a value since some reset time.
    </para>
    <para>
        The second version is a set of <classname>CTreeParameter</classname>
        and <classname>CTreeParameterArray</classname> objects.  This
        version was introduced by Daniel Bazin to attach additiona meta data
        to parameters and to allow parameters to be organized into structures
        that better reflect the organization of the experiment being analyzed.
        The tree paramter subsystem was adopted by SpecTcl and is now supported
        software.
    </para>
    <para>
        Currently we recommend the use of tree parameters over the flat
        representation of the <classname>CEvent</classname> array as they
        are much easier to manage.  This manual is written with tree parameters
        in mind.
    </para>
    <section>
        <title>Event Processors</title>
        <para>
            Event processors are objects that are instances of classes
            derived from the <classname>CEventProcessor</classname> 
            base class.  This class is defined in the SpecTcl header:
            <filename>EventProcessor.h</filename>
        </para>
        <para>
            The class provides the interface between the high level parser and
            the event processing pipeline.  The high level parsing subsystem
            will invoke methods of each event processor as determined by its
            high level analysis of the contents of the data.  Let's have a
            look at the important parts of the <filename>EventProcessor.h</filename>
            header.

            First note that none of the virtual methods are pure virtual.
            All have default implementations that do nothing.  This allows you
            to only implement the methods you need. 
        </para>
        <para>
            Second, note that all methods return a <type>Bool_t</type> value.
            This is an enumerated type that can have the values
            <literal>kfTRUE</literal> or <literal>kfFALSE</literal>.  The return
            value indicates whether SpecTcl should continue processing the
            event that caused the method to be called.  If
            <literal>kfTRUE</literal> is returned, processing continues and,
            for a physics event, the event sink pipeline will be entered if all
            elements returned that.  If <literal>kfFALSE</literal> is returned,
            event processing is halted immediately.  No further stages of the
            event processing pipeline will be called and the event sink pipeline
            won't be invoked for physics events.
        </para>
        <para>
            Before looking at these methods; we can see a couple of data types
            are passed to many of these methods;  an instance of a 
            <classname>CBufferDecoder</classname> and an instance of a
            <classname>CAnalyzer</classname>
        </para>
        <para>
            These objects are components of the high level parsing subsystem.
            The <classname>CBufferDecoder</classname> is responsible for
            picking apart the raw data into elements of known types.  The
            <classname>CAnalyzer</classname> is passed elements or groups of
            elements and is responsible for running the event processing
            pipeline.   For most event processor methods, you can ignroe these
            parameters.   The physics event processor, however has some
            requirements that must be met.  We will describe those requirements
            in a bit.
        </para>
        <para>
            A quick point about these high level parsing subsystem objects.
            They do provide services that may be useful to some event processing
            methods.  The <classname>CAnalyzer</classname> used in SpecTcl by
            default is actually a <classname>CTclAnalyzer</classname> object.
            When we describe the event processor's responsibilities we will
            come back to this latter fact.
        </para>

            Let's look at each event processor method in turn.  The order
            below is the approximate order in which these methods will be called.

                        <parameter>pEvent</parameter> parameter is a pointer to
                        the start of the event body.  For data formats,
                        that provide headers to the event, the decoder
                        object will typically provide methods to access those
                        headers.

                    <para>
                        The <parameter>rEvent</parameter> parameter is a reference
                        to the event array that is the ultimate output of the
                        event processing pipeline for physics events.
                        <parameter>rEvent</parameter> is an array-like object
                        of <classname>ValidValue</classname> objects.
                        You can think of <parameter>rEvent</parameter> as an
                        array that automatically expands as  needed to fit
                        the largest index it's passed.

                    <para>
                        On the left hand side of an assignment, you can think of
                        elements of <parameter>rEvent</parameter> as double
                        precision reals.   In an expression, however the
                        additional properties of a <classname>ValidValue</classname>
                        object become visible.  Specifically these objects
                        can be reset to an undefined state and will throw
                        an exception if referenced prior to having been assigned
                        a new value (having become valid).
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        At the beginning of event processing; and as elements
                        are added to <varname>rEvent</varname>, the valid values
                        in it are reset to be invalid by SpecTcl.  Prior to using
                        an element of <varname>rEvent</varname> within an
                        expression, you need to ensure that it is valid.  This can
                        be done either by reasoning about the flow of the computation
                        or by invoking the <methodname>isValid</methodname> method
                        which returns <literal>true</literal> if the element
                        was assigned.  Performing a read reference on a
                        <classname>ValidValue</classname> that has not
                        yet been assigned a value results in an exception.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Using tree parameters allows you to avoid direct referencing
                        of the <varname>rEvent</varname> array, referencing
                        instead specific <classname>CTreeParameter</classname>
                        objects or elements of specific <classname>CTreeParameterArray</classname>
                        objects that have been bound to <varname>rEvent</varname>
                        elements.  The comments about validity checking are still
                        relevent however.

                    In order to be able to do all of the processing we want to
                    do, we need to invoke members of the decoder that are
                    specific to the decoder for ring buffers;
                    <classname>CRingBufferDecoder</classname>.  This dynamic
                    cast takes the generic decoder and attempts to coerce its

                    Dynamic casts make use of run time type information (RTTI)
                    embedded in objects to ensure that the cast being attempted
                    is legal.  If the <parameter>rDecoder</parameter> object
                    actual type cannot be treated as a

                    with several static methods that create ring item objects.
                    The version of the creational method we use takes a pointer
                    to the raw data in a ring item.  The
                    <classname>CRingBufferDecoder</classname>::<methodname>getItemPointer</methodname>
                    method returns a pointer to the ring item the buffer decoder
                    is processing, has handed off to the analyzer which in turn
                    invoked our <methodname>OnOther</methodname> method.

            <para>
                If we made SpecTcl afterr modifying the Makefile as described
                above, our event processor would still not be run.  SpecTcl
                requires explicity management of the event processing pipeline.
                This management can be static, establishing the pipeline at
                initialization, or dynamic, modifying the pipeline during
                SpecTcl's run.
            </para>

        <para>
            In this section, we'll use static event processing pipeline management
            to tell SpecTcl to run our event processor.  To do this, we must
            modify the framework file that came from the skeleton,
            <filename>MySpecTclApp.cpp</filename>.  This class is a
            specialization of a class that provides SpecTcl with application
            specific initialization strategy callouts.

        <para>
            As SpecTcl starts it invokes methods in this class at specific times
            and for specific purposes.  <methodname>CreateAnalysisPipeline</methodname>
            is invoked when it's time to establish the initial analysis pipeline.
            For most cases, the initial analysis pipeline is all you need.
            It is possible, however to modify the pipeline in flight.

            The base class for <classname>CMySpecTclApp</classname>, provides

            <methodname>RegisterEventProcessor</methodname> appends an instance
            of an event processor to the end of the analysis pipeline.
        </para>

            Therfore, to create a SpecTcl that has an event processing pipeline

        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Add an <literal>#include</literal> directive to include
                    our event processor's header to
                    <filename>MySpecTclApp.cpp</filename>

                    in <filename>MySpecTclApp.cpp</filename> so that
                    only our event processor is registered.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            At the top of <filename>MySpecTclApp.cpp</filename>
        </para>
        <informalexample>

            </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
            Note that <filename>MySpecTclApp.cpp</filename> is an example
            and includes a sample event processing pipeline setup that must be
            removed.
            Make the body of <methodname>CreateAnalysisPipeline</methodname>
            look like this:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Creating a static event processing pipeline</title>
            <programlisting>

void
CMySpecTclApp::CreateAnalysisPipeline(CAnalyzer&amp; rAnalyzer)
{
  RegisterEventProcessor(*(new MyEventProcessor), "Raw-unpacker");

}
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The <methodname>RegisterEventProcessor</methodname> method is
            described completely in the programmer reference.   It takes
            a mandatory prameter and and optional one.
        </para>
        <para>
            The first parameter is a reference to the event processor object
            that should be appended to the the pipeline of processors.  The
            lifetime of the object must be the time it is in the analysis pipeline.
            Unless you are doing dynamic pipeline managemenet, this is the
            run time of the program.
        </para>
        <para>
            The second parameter is optional.  It is a character string name
            that is associated with the processor.  If an uncaught exception
            is thrown by an event processor, the exception is reported along
            with the name of the event processor that threw it.  If no
            name is provided one is selected for the processor.  Providing
            a name makes it a bit easier to determine the source of an
            exception.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once these changes have been made, SpecTcl can be compiled and
            the resulting tailored SpecTcl will have an event processing pipeline
            that consists of only our event processor.

        <title>Playing back filter data</title>
        <para>
            A SpecTcl filter is a mechanism that allows you to transform a raw
            data set into a decoded subset of the data.  By decoded subset we mean
            that:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Only events that satisfy the filter's gate are written to the
                    filtered data set.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A subset of the parameters decoded from each event are
                    written to the data set.
                </para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            Since the structure of the raw event is lost, and since any parameter
            can be written to the output file, the event processing pipeline
            used to analyze data from a raw event file is not useful in analyzing
            filter files:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    There is no raw event to decode into raw parameters.

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Parameters computed by later stages of the pipeline can
                    already be present in the event file.

            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            When analyzing filter files you must therefore:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Register an initial stage of the event analysis pipeline
                    that can read the filter file.

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Register subsequent stages that compute parameters that
                    are not already present in the filter file.  You could think
                    of analysis as performing an initial broad cut on the data
                    and then subsequently only producing physically meaningful
                    parameter on this subset.  The event processor that computes
                    these parameters would be in the pipeline for analyzing
                    filtered data.

            In this section, we're going to look at how to set up the first
            element of an analysis pipeline that can analyze filter data.  In
            the next section, we'll look at an extension to SpecTcl that allows
            you to dynamically switch SpecTcl between the analysis of raw data
            and filtered data.
        </para>
        <para>
            SpecTcl provides an event processor that can decode any filter file.
            The parameters in the filter file are decoded into parameters of
            the name they had when they were written..
            If a parameter is found in the filter file, but
            is not defined in SpecTcl when the filter is read back, it is
            ignored without reporting an error.
        </para>
        <para>
            The filter event processor element must be registered as the first

    <title>The SpecTcl API</title>
    <para>
        The <classname>SpecTcl</classname> class provides an application programming
        interface (API) to SpecTcl's internals.  If you use it rather than poking
        about directly in SpecTcl's data structures, we can promise you your
        program will be immune from internal re-organizations of SpecTcl's
        parameter, spectrum and gate dictionaries.
        <classname>SpecTcl</classname> also provides access to the event analysis
        pipeline, the event sing pipeline
        (described in <link linkend='chap.eventsinkpipeline' endterm='chap.eventsinkpipeline.title' />),
        filters and several other objects.
    </para>
    <para>
        In this chapter we'll take a brief tour of the <classname>SpecTcl</classname>
        class facilities and provide examples of its use.  Full reference information
        is provided in the programmer reference manual.

        The <classname>SpecTcl</classname> class impleements the

        What you mostly need to know about singletons is that the class is written
        in a way to ensure that only one instance of the class is ever created.
        The mechanics of this are to:

        <listitem>
            <para>
                Provide a method (<methodname>getInstance</methodname>) that
                returns a pointer to the single instance of the class, creating
                it if needed.

    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        This means that to use the <classname>SpecTcl</classname> class, rather
        than constructing an object you'll have code like:

        can then invoke methods on that API object just like any other object.

                <para>
                    In  most cases, since tree parameters with the same name
                    map to the same low level parameter, an API for the tree

                    dictionary.  Iterators are a generalization of pointers for
                    any ordered container.  The main thing to know about
                    them for this example is that they can be dereferenced to
                    give something in the container and they can be incremented

                    Dictionaries in SpecTcl consist of pairs.  The first element

                    part of the C++ 2011 standard.  It can be used instead of
                    a specific type when the compiler should be able to
                    infer a type from the expression.  In this case,
                    since <methodname>SpecTcl::BeginParameters()</methodname>
                    returns a <classname>ParameterDictionaryIterator</classname>,
                    the compiler can infer that this should be the type of

                <para>
                    To use this type inferenece you need to add

                    should compile to the 2011 standard.

        <para>
            The Spectrum part of the API allows you to manipulate the spectrum
            dictionary.  This allows you to define spectra of all supported
            spectrum types as  well as to enter them in the spectrum dictionary
            and to iterate over that dictionary.
        </para>
        <para>
            Another important capability is the ability to add spectrum dictionary
            observers.  A spectrum dictionary observer is invoked whenever the
            spectrum dictionary changes either due to a spectrum creation or
            a spectrum deletion.

            Suppose, for example, we have some imaging detector and want to
            make SpecTcl display an image (such as the projection of track in
            a TCP onto some plane).  We could do this by defining an dummy
            2-d spectrum (a 2-d spectrum on parameters that are never set), and
            filling in that spectrum with the appropiate image when requested.

                    and z is the value to store.  We'll assume that only the

                    This method is part of the iteration interface.  It returns

                    are no non-zero pixels, the result will be the same as that
                    returned from the <methodname>end</methodname>.

                    <methodname>next</methodname> would return if iteration
                    has completed.  It is important to note that the
                    end pointer does not point to a valid pixel and should
                    not be dereferenced (very likely it's the <literal>nullptr</literal>).

                    this will return the same value that
                    <methodname>end</methodname> returns.  This means a typical

        <para>
            The SpecTcl class provides a family of creationals that
            allow you to create any of the types of gates SpecTcl supports and
            to add them to the gate dictionary.
        </para>
        <para>
            Gates in SpecTcl are mutable.  That is once defined a gate can be
            modified.  This modification may change the gate type.   In order
            to allow gate checking to be done without regard to this mutability,
            software that checks gates should hold <classname>CGateContainer</classname>
            objects rather than directly holding <classname>CGate</classname>
            objects.
        </para>
        <para>
            <classname>CGateContainer</classname> objects provide an additional
            level of indirection.  Linguistically , they look like pointers.
            What they point to, however, can be dynamically modified by
            SpecTcl.   Thus a gate container that points to a specific named
            can be used to check that named gate regardless of changes
            that may have been made to that gate.
        </para>
        <para>
            This means that if you create a gate and add it to the dictionary,
            rather than holding on to the <classname>CGate*</classname> object
            and checking that, you should, instead, then use
            <methodname>FindGate</methodname> to obtain a gate container
            that you can use to reference the new gate.
        </para>
        <para>
            The example we're going to use demonstrates this;  We're going to
            show how to create a parameter whose value reflects which of several
            gate (if any) an event satisfied.  One use for this is to create
            a particle ID 1-d spectrum where the channels of the spectrum
            represent individual particle types.

            <title>NOTE</title>
            <para>
                The discussion above means that our event processor must be
                placed in the event processing pipeline <emphasis>after</emphasis>
                all parameters have been set.  This is because gates are
                evaluated on the parameters of the event, not on the
                raw event data.
            </para>
        </note>
        <para>
            Before turning to code, there's a bit more background that must
            be provided.
        </para>
        <para>
            Gate evaluations get cached.    That is once a gate is evaluated,
            a second evaluation just refers to the cached value.  The
            event sink pipeline invalidates the cached values prior to each event.
            This is done so that costly gate evaluations are only done once
            even though there may be several compound gates that refer to them.
        </para>
        <para>
            This is a problem because in order to improve program cache hit
            performance in SpecTcl, several events are run through the
            event processing pipeline before being passed on as a bunch to
            the evetn sink pipeline.
        </para>
        <para>
            What this means for us is that we have to invalidate the cache
            for each gate each event manually in our event processor.  If we don't
            our code will seem to run properly but we'll get runs of the same
            PID for groups of events where only the first event in each run
            is properly identified.
        </para>

            Let's look at the header for our event processor.

                    For each pass through the loop, we get a reference to the
                    appropriate gate container.  The reference can be treated
                    as if it were a pointer to the underlying gate.
                    We will make use of this.  Notationally this is much
                    simpler than dealing with the pointer to the gate container
                    directly.

                    For each gate, we must clear its cached value before
                    checking it.  This was explained previously.

                <para>
                    This statement checks the gate.  As you can see the gate
                    check method requires a reference to the
                    <classname>CEvent</classname> being built for this event.
                    This is why our event processor must be registered
                    <emphasis>after</emphasis> <classname>CEvent</classname>
                    has been filled in for this event.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Remember that the gate we created may not be the gate we're
                    checking.  It can have different limit points, it can
                    be a different gate type. It could be on a different parameter
                    or set of parameters, depending on what the user has done.

                <para>
                    If the gate check operation returns true, the gate has
                    been satisfied by the contents of the <classname>CEvent</classname>
                    object it was given.  In this case, we set the
                    <literal>PID</literal> parameter to the index of the gate
                    which was satisfied.  If no gate is satisfied, the
                    <literal>PID</literal> parameter has no value for this event.
                    Any spectrum on it won't be incremented.

                <para>
                    Note that after checking the gates we don't need to reset
                    their cache.  This is because, if there are more events
                    to be processed prior to starting the event sink pipeline,
                    we'll reset the cache as part of gate processing.
                    If the event sink pipeline will be called, it will reset
                    the cache on all defined gates prior to running that pipeline
                    for each event.

            The API provides methods that allow you to dynamically change
            the contents of the event processing pipeline.  You can add
            event processors at any point in the pipeline, remove them
            from any point in the pipeline and iterate the pipeline.
        </para>

            The example we will show in this section will be one that can
            swap out, and back, entire event processing pipelines.  Our
            specific use case will be to save the contents of an event processing
            pipeline so that it can be restored later, clear the pipeline
            and insert the event processor that can unpack filter files.

            Since emptying the event processing pipeline is also needed

            Much of this should be straightforward.  The only bits that are
            interesting is that the call to

            a reference to the event processor and a <type>const char*</type>

            Finally to set up SpecTcl to read data from filtered data files,

            In all of this, the assumption is that prior to this,
            if someone wants the event processing pipeline restored,
            they will have first invoked
            <methodname>save</methodname> to do that.

        The SpecTcl event sink pipeline.
    </title>
    <para>
        If the event processing pipeline takes the raw event and produces
        a set of parameters, the event sink pipeline operates on those
        parameters.  The most important event sink pipeline element is the
        hisotogrammer.  That's the part of SpecTcl that increments histograms
        depending on the definitions in the parameter, spectrum and gate dictionaries
        as well as the application of gates t spectra.
    </para>
    <para>
        Filters are another important class of event sink pipeline element.
        Each filter is appended to the event sink pipeline and allowed to
        process event lists to produce filtered event files.
    </para>
    <para>
        It is also possible to add processors to the even sink pipeline.
        Processors in the event sink pipeline are subclassed from
        <classname>CEventSink</classname> defined in
        <filename>EventSink.h</filename>.  They can override the following
        virtual methods:

                    This method is pure virtual in the base class and therefore

                    <filename>EventList.h</filename>.  You can either get the
                    underlying vector of <classname>CEvent</classname> pointers
                    or iterate through it using its iterator interface.

        Let's look at an example event sink processor.  The processor will
        be pretty simple.  It's going to maintain, and periodically output,
        the number of events processed and the total number of parameters
        that have been given values. 
    </para>
    <para>
        To do this efficiently, we're going to need to delve into the nasty
        corners of the <classname>CEvent</classname> class.  Specifically,
        while,  for each event, we can find out how many parameters
        are defined by iterating that object and asking each parameter
        if its defined, for large analysis cases this can be very inefficent.
    </para>
    <para>
        The fact that this iteration can be so inefficient brings us to an
        optimization that SpecTcl uses to ensure that the histogrammer neither
        has to iterate over the parameters in an event, nor iterate over the
        histograms that have been defined.  This optimization is incredibly
        good for <firstterm>sparse analysis</firstterm>.
    </para>
    <para>
        Sparse analysis means that for a large analysis case, large number of
        parameters, and/or large number of histograms, for any event, we really
        are only going to assign values to a small percentage of parameters
        and have to increment a very small subset of the histograms.
    </para>
    <para>
        SpecTcl's <classname>CEvent</classname> helps SpecTcl to iterate over
        the sparse parameter space by building, as each parameter is defined,
        a <firstterm>DopeVector</firstterm>.  A dope vector is just a vector
        whose elements are indices to those elements that have been defined.
        Using the dope vector makes our life simple;  The number of elements
        in a <classname>CEvent</classname> object's dope vector is the
        number of parameters that have been given values for that event.
    </para>
    <para>
        This background out of the way; lets look at the class header first:

        The purpose of the <varname>m_nPeriod </varname> and
        <parameter>period</parameter> attributes and variables are to
        define how often we output statistics.

        all events.

        One of the important features of the Tcl scripting language is that it
        is easily extensible.  Application specific commands can be added, not only
        as <command>proc</command>s but also as native, compiled commands.  The
        SpecTcl framework provides hooks for adding commands as SpecTcl starts.

        We'll wrap a <firstterm>command ensemble</firstterm> around an instance

        Many Tcl objects require that they be bound to an interpreter to function
        properly.  For example, a variable only makes sense within an interpreter
        as does a command.   The base class for such objects is a
        <classname>CTCLInterpreterObject</classname>, defined in
        <filename>TCLInterpreterObject.h</filename>.

    <para>
        This class provides mechiansms to bind the object to an intepreter
        after construction and to get the interpreter to which the object

        if the object is not currently associated with an interpreter.

            Tcl 8.0 introduced <firstterm>dual port objects</firstterm>.  These
            attempt to solve an efficiency problem that is due to Tcl's core
            concept that evertyhing can be treated as a string.

    </formalpara>
    <para>
        Prior to 8.0, variables were, in fact, stored as strings by the interpreter.
        Dual port objects provide the ability to maintain a second representation.
        This prevents costly conversions from strings to other types as needed.
        It also allows for optimized representations for types such as lists
        and dicts.

        The Tcl type <type>Tcl_Obj*</type> is a pointer to an opaque type
        that represents the dual ported object.  Tcl API methods allow you to
        manipulate these copy on write, reference counted objects in many ways.

        With that background, start looking at the nitty gritty of wrapping
        our <classname>EVPSwitcher</classname> class in a command ensemble.
    </para>
    <para>
        A command ensemble can be thought of as an object.  It has a command
        name and methods that are represented as sub-commands.  The sub commands
        are the first argument followig the command word.  We're going to do
        a very minimal mapping providing the following subcommands:

                This object is going to be manipulated by the command.  This
                pattern is very common for Tcl extensions;
                First develop an API for the functionality we want implemented.
                In this case, that functionality is encapsulated in an object
                of type <classname>EVPSwitcher</classname>.  Next develop
                a Tcl command that manipulates that API.  
            </para>
            <para>
                This pattern separates the concerns of what has to be done
                from processing the commands that do it.  A clean separation
                of these concerns would allow, for example, SpecTcl and this
                extension to be migrated to a different host scripting language
                (such as Python for example).
            </para>

            <para>
                <classname>CTCLObjectProcessor</classname> objects
                must implement a function call operator
                (<methodname>operator()</methodname>).  This method is invoked
                by the Tcl++ library when the command registered by the
                object has been invoked.
            </para>
            <para>
                The method is passed a reference to the interpreter that is
                executing the command and a vector of
                <classname>CTCLObject</classname> objects.  The vector
                represents the command words that make up the Tcl command
                being executed.  Note that element 0 of this vector is
                the command itself.

        <callout arearefs='cmd.swcommand.handlers'>
            <para>
                A common pattern in command ensembles is for top level processing
                (in this case <methodname>operator()</methodname>) to
                validate there's a subcommand and dispatch to a specific
                handler for each subcommand.  We're going to follow that approach.
                These methods are the handlers for each subcommand.
            </para>

    </calloutlist>
    <para>
        Let's look at the constructor.  The only responsibility it has is
        to register the command with the SpecTcl interpreter.  The interpreter
        is passed in.  We're also passing in the command name string in case
        circumstances force us to use a different command name.
    </para>
    <para>
        Here's the constructor implementation, therefore:

                in the command result and result in a return value of

            <para>
                Extracts the subcommand string from the first parameter to the
                command.   This makes use of one of the many conversion operations
                in <classname>CTCLObject</classname> that can access the
                string or non-string representations of the underlying
                <type>Tcl_Object*</type> encapsulated by

                If any of these type conversions fail, a

        <callout arearefs='cmd.op.dispatch'>
            <para>
                This if/else chain does the actual dispatch of the subcommand
                to the proper handler.  The handlers are expected to signal
                their errors via an exception.  That allows them to be
                declared as type <type>void</type> and makes it unecessary
                to explicitly check if they've succeeded.
            </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs='cmd.op.nomatch'>
            <para>
                This defends against the user providing a bad subcommand.
                We throw an exception which is caught below, turned into
                the command result and an unsuccessful return value.

        <callout arearefs='cmd.op.errorhandling'>
            <para>
                These catch blocks handle various types of exceptions we might
                expect during command processing.  In each case, error text
                is extracted from the exception and turned into the interpreter
                result and <literal>TCL_ERROR</literal> is returned.  This
                tells the interpreter the command failed.  The return value
                of a failed command becomes the error message the interpreter
                will emit.
            </para>
            <para>
                In the event the command is executed with the Tcl
                <command>catch</command> command, this will be the message
                returned when the value of the <command>catch</command> is
                nonzero.
            </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs='cmd.op.unexpectedcatch'>
            <para>
                This catch will get control if an exception we've not explicitly
                caught is emitted (note that <classname>CException</classname>
                and <classname>std::exception</classname> are base classes
                that can catch a wide variety of actual exceptions).
                In that case we fabricate a return value and still
                return <literal>TCL_ERROR</literal>.
            </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs='cmd.op.success' >
            <para>
                If control drops all the way through the try/catch block,
                the command succeeded and <literal>TCL_OK</literal> is
                returned to indicate that to the interpreter.
                The individual command processors are responsible for
                setting the command result in that case, if appropriate.
            </para>

        In your case, the subcommand handlers are all pretty simple.  Therefore

        <title>Adding a CSV file format to spectrum read/write</title>
        <para>
            In this section we're going to walk through the problem
            of writing a new formatter and making it known to the
            SpecTcl <command>sread</command> and <command>swrite</command>
            commands.
        </para>
        <para>
            The format will be a simple CSV file format.  For 1-d spectra,
            a spectrum contains a single line of comma separated
            channel values.  For 2-d spectra, each line is a scan line
            of the spectrum.
            For simplicity(?) no metadata will be stored or restored.  Read
            will only create 1-d and 2-d snapshot spectra.

            is the y coordinate of the scanline and <parameter>n</parameter>
            the number of channels on each scanline.  Here is the  implementation

                  Fetches the number of dimensions the spectrum has.  This is

                  count or Axis count as these can be misleading for some spectrum
                  types.
              </para>
          </callout>
          <callout arearefs='spcfmt.write.xdim'>
              <para>
                  Retrieves the number of channels on the X axis.  All spectra have

                  On the other hand, if the spectrum has two dimensions, the number

          Reading in a spectrum in CSV form requires that we have some way

                        people listing spectra that the parameter is meaningless
                        from the point of view of other analysis,.

        Extending SpecTcl's filter file formats
    </title>
    <para>
        Filters are objects int he event sink pipeline that produce
        reduced data set output files.  Filters reduce data by a combination
        of selecting events and selecting a subset of parameters in each selected
        event.
    </para>
    <para>
        Typically filtered data is self describing and, therefore, faster to analyze
        because parsing is simplified.  SpecTcl supports a native filter format
        based on the SUN XDR source independent data representation.  Data in
        XDR files can be decoded regardless of the byte ordering of the source
        and sink systems.
    </para>
    <para>
        The filter formats supported by SpecTcl are extensible.  In fact,
        a plugin allows filtered data to be written in a format friendly to
        the CERN <ulink url='http://root.cern.ch'>ROOT</ulink> program.  (See
        <link linkend='chap.plugins' endterm='chap.plugins.title' />

            It's not enoubh to have a filter output stage.  The <command>filter</command>

            given a value for the <command>filter -format</command> command.

            In this section, we'll build a simple filter formatter.  We're not
            going to build an unpacker for it because that raises a few issues
            beyond the scope of this part of the document.  We're just going to

        The fit types available in the SpecTcl fitting subsystem are quite restricted.
        SpecTcl' fitting is not intended to replace that of full fledged offline

                        Fit objects are state-full.  They alternate between

                        and having performed the fit (<literal>Performed</literal>.
                        Fit parameters can only be retrieved from the fit when it
                        is in the <literal>Performed</literal> state.

                        interest in a spectrum, it can be repeatedly performed

            The methods are all defined as <literal>static</literal> which means
            this class never actually needs any instances.  All methods

        Interfacing SpecTcl with data from other data acquisition systems.
    </title>
    <para>
        SpecTcl tries hard to be data acquisition system agnostic.  This begins
        with not having any direct connection to specific online systems and
        extens to the way in which events received from a data source are parsed
        into chucks of events which are then passed to the analyzer which
        forwards them on to the event processing pipeline.
    </para>
    <para>
        Let's have a look at how this all hangs together:
    </para>
    <figure>
        <title>SpecTcl event decode process</title>
        <graphic format='PNG' fileref='Datadecode.png' />
    </figure>
    <para>
        SpecTcl's data comes from data sources.  Each data source type has a
        I/O class.  This class passes fixed sized blocks of data to a buffer
        decoder object.  The buffer decoder object.  
    </para>
    <para>
        The buffer decoder is supposed to understand how data are packaged by
        the source data acquisition system.   It is supposed to pass blocks
        of events to the analyzer in a way that allows that object to call the
        event processing pipeline.  Secondarily, the decoder is supposed to
        create and make avaialble information about the source system byte
        ordering so that clients of the data can construct appropriate data
        translation objects.
    </para>
    <para>
        The buffer decoder is selected by the <command>attach</command> command.
        The class that implements that provides a method for extending the
        set of values for its <option>-format</option> switch.
    </para>
    <para>
        Note that this has actually been done for two non NSCL data acquisition
        systems over the life of SpecTcl (that I know about).  Specifically,
        SpecTcl has analyzed data from IUCF XSYS (at Kansas State University's
        Macdonald Laboratory), and from the Lucid data acquisition system (at
        the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory, decommissioned in 1999).

        <title>The classes involved in getting data from source to analyzer</title>

            SpecTcl uses classes derived from the following base classes to
            get data from data source to analyzer:

                        data from file data sources.  It is also the base class
                        for <classname>CPipeFile</classname> which gets data
                        from a program helper along a pipe.

                        object has been asked to read a block of data from its
                        encapsulated file descriptor, that block of data is passed
                        to the <classname>CBufferDecoder</classname>.  That
                        object unpackes items from the data block and

                        This operates by encapsulating a

                        define the byte order of the originating system.
                        These are compared against signature bytes generated

            Let's loopk at the <classname>CFile</classname>, <classname>CBufferDecoder</classname>,

            <classname>TranslatorPointer</classname>, <classname>BufferTranslator</classname>
            and <classname>BufferFactory</classname> are quite tightly coupled

            <para>
                This class and its derivations supply I/O support for SpecTcl.
                Early versions of SpecTcl supported ANSI labeled tapes as a
                data source in addition to disk files and pipes.  This support
                was removed since very few if any people want to analyze data
                directly from tape.
            </para>
        </formalpara>
        
        <para>
            The base class for I/O support is <classname>CFile</classname>
            and it is not an abstract class but supports disk file I/O.
            This class is defined in <filename>File.h</filename>
            Technically it could also be used to read data from tapes that
            have been prepositioned to the appropriate data file.

                        The analyzer collects all events into an event list
                        (a wrapped vector of events).  This event list is then
                        iterated over to send events to the analysis pipeline.
                        This method returns a reference to the event list.

                        The event pool is a <classname>CEventList</classname> that contains
                        invalidated events that may be handed to runs of the 
                        event analysis pipeline. The Analyzer passes events from
                        the event pool to the analysis pipeline, whereupon they
                        are put in the event list.  The event list is passed,
                        event by event, to the event sink pipeline whereupon
                        each event is invalidated and putback in the event pool.

                        emit <firstterm>super events</firstterm>.  A super event
                        is an event like chunk of data that contains several
                        events.  An example of a use of super events would
                        be processing hardware containing multi-event buffers.
                        The devices might be drained responding to a single trigger
                        leaving a structure that contains several physics events.

                    <para>
                        In cases like that, the event processing pipeline needs
                        to be invoked for each event contained in the super
                        event and therefore needs control over when to report
                        that it has completed processing of the outer entity.

                        Another alternative is to produce a buffer decoder
                        that treats each super event as a run of events, however
                        that would require that the buffer decoder know enough
                        about the internal structure of the super event to
                        be able to determine the number of events each
                        super event contains.

                        transform arbitrary byte order differences between 16
                        and 32 bit values.  In practice, there are two byte orderings
                        in use in computer systems throughout the world.
                        Little endian (predominates because it is what Intel uses),
                        and Big endian.

                        If we view memory as an array of 8 bit bytes, for multi-byte
                        values, little endian systems store the low order bytes in
                        lower addresses while big endian systems store the high order
                        bytes in lower addresses.

                        Thus the byte-wise representation of <literal>0x0102034</literal>,
                        the 32 bit byte order signature for little endian systems
                        is: <literal>0x04, 0x03, 0x02, 0x01</literal> while on a
                        bit endian system, the same signature's byte-wise values are:
                        <literal>0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04</literal>.

                        indicatiuon of its byte ordering in the data, this method
                        should transform that indicator into the byte order signatures
                        expected by SpecTcl.  If not, you have to use your knowledge
                        of the byte ordering of the source system to construct
                        these signatures out of thin air.

                SpecTcl provides a set of classes that allow programmers to
                instantiate pointer-like objects that can transparenty perform
                any required byte order transformations between the source system
                and the SpecTcl host system.    The following sets of classes are required:
                <classname>BufferTranslator</classname> encapsulates a buffer of
                data and allows fetches to be done from that bufer, returning
                data in the byte order of the executing host.  The
                <classname>BufferFactory</classname> class can provide you with
                a <classname>BufferTranslator</classname> given the 32 bit
                byte order signature of the source system.

            bears some resemblence to the ring buffer data format used by
            NSCLDAQ 10.x and later, however that resemblance is purely coincidental
            and you should not conclude from it that any of this code is actually
            used by SpecTcl to decode NSCLDAQ data.

            Let's implement <methodname>translateItemType</methodname> before
            we turn to the getter menthods.  The only choice we really need
            to make is how to handle item types that are not yet defined.
            For now we'll add the type to <literal>MAXSYSBUFTYPE</literal>
            turning it into a user item type.  In doing so, we're making the
            implicit assumption item types won't be zero.
        </para>

            The only thing interesting is the use of an std::map.  This is an
            associative container.  It maps keys to values supporting an efficent
            <methodname>find</methodname> method.  The <literal>auto</literal> keyword
            declaring <varname>p</varname> allows the compiler to infer the type
            to be <type>std::map&lt;std::uint32_t, std::uint32_t&gt;::iterator</type>.
            This is a pointer like object to an std::pair whose first member is a
            map index and whose second is the value of the map entry associated
            with that index.

    <title id='chap.plugins.title'>SpecTcl plugins</title>
    <para>
        Until now we've only talked about code that is statically compiled
        into SpecTcl to extend its functionlity.  Plugins are shared libraries
        that are loaded on command to dynamically extend SpecTcl's functionality
        at run time.  Two examples of plugins that are available from the NSCl are
        the Radware I/O plugin that adds commands to save spectra in Radware format
        and the Root Filter format plugin that adds the ability to save filtered
        data as Root Ntuples so filtered events can easily be impoted to Root.
    </para>
    <para>
        The ability to write a SpecTcl plugin really comes as a natural consequence
        of using Tcl as the SpecTcl command langauge.  The Tcl built in command
        <command>load</command> loads a shared library and invokes a specific
        initialization function.  This in conjunction with the SpecTcl
        package subsystem allows plugins to be defined, made known to SpecTcl
        and loaded via the <command>package require</command> Tcl command.

            We're going to start this section with a discussion of the initialization
            function as we've already got code to support our plugin's functionality.
            The name of the initialization function is important.   The name of the
            initialization function is derived from the name of the shared library
            you are making by:

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Removing the trailing .so and anything after that
                    (e.g. version numbers).
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Making the first name of all that remains upper case.

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Making all the remaining parts of the name lower case.

        </orderedlist>
        <para>
            So, for example,  if we decide we're going to build the
            shared library: <filename>libSomeDaqDecoder.so</filename>,
            our initialization function must be called:
            <function>Somedaqdecoder_Init</function>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The function receives the interpreter (raw interpreter of type
            <type>Tcl_Interp*</type>) as its only argument and, on success
            is supposed to return <literal>TCL_OK</literal>, and on failure
            <literal>TCL_ERROR</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The initialization function should:
        </para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Initialize the Tcl stubs interface, if Tcl is stubs enabled
                    and you want your extension to be stubs enabled (you should
                    as this insulates you from the exact Tcl version SpecTcl
                    is built with enabling your plugin to be more portable).
                </para>
                <para>
                    This is done by invoking <function>Tcl_InitStubs</function>.
                    You must also be sure to link your plugin to the stubs
                    library rather than Tcl directly.

            Much of this is best covered by example in the next section.
            We'll say a bit here about packages, package indices and the package
            load process.  This will serve as a bit of background on how to
            distribute your plugin so that it can be incorporated into SpecTcl.
            Note that this is a Tcl topic, not a SpecTcl topic.

        <para>
            When Tcl processes the <command>package require</command> command
            for a package that isn ot already loaded, it searches the directories
            in <varname>auto_path</varname> one by one for a file named
            <filename>pkgIndex.tcl</filename>.  If that file is located, it is
            sourced into the interpreter.
        </para>
        <para>
            Typically <filename>pkgIndex</filename> will contain a series of
            <command>package ifneeded</command> commands that define how
            to load a set of packages into the interpreter.  When sourced,
            the Tcl variable <varname>dir</varname> is the full path
            to the directory in which the <filename>pkgIndex.tcl</filename>
            script is installed.
        </para>
        <para>
            The form of the <command>package ifneeded</command> command is:

        <cmdsynopsis>
            <command>
package ifneeded <replaceable>name version load-script</replaceable>

        <para>
            Where <parameter>name</parameter> is the name of a package,
            <parameter>version</parameter> is a version of that package and
            <parameter>load-script</parameter> are the commands needed to
            load that package into the interpreter.  Note that the
            <command>package require</command> command can specify a version
            as well as matching criteria and you can have
            <command>package ifneeded</command> commands for several versions
            of the same package.
        </para>
        <para>
            For a compiled extension, the script must be a <command>load</command>
            command for the appropriate shared library.  For example for
            libSomDaqDecoder.so, providing version 1.0 of the package
            SomeDaqDecoder, the <filename>pkgIndex.tcl</filename> file might
            contain:

package ifneeded SomeDaqDecoder 1.0  \

        <para>
            The Tcl <command>list</command> command can be used to build up
            command forcing appropriate quoting and the
            <command>file join</command> command supplies a system independent
            mechanism for joining file path elements in to a file path.

            In this section we will take concrete steps to turn the
            the buffer decoder developed in the previous chapter into a plugin.

                Since the Tcl API is written in C it is important not to allow
                C++ to modify the name of our initialization  entry point to
                indicate the argument signature (name decoration or mangling is
                how C++ supports function name overloading in the face of
                linkers that know nothing of argument signatures).
                The <literal>extern "C"</literal> declaration here means that
                the block of code that follows will use C not C++ linkage
                conventions wich, in turn, means that function names won't get

You must have exactly one data source type
Usage:
  attach {switches...} connection
  Where:
     Switches are taken from the following:
     -format {format type}
     -size nBytes - Number of bytes per buffer.
     {sourcetype} which can be only one of:
        -file  when connection is the name of the file
               from which data will be taken
        -pipe  When connection is a command whose stdout is
               taken as the event source.
        -test  When connection selects one of the test data sources
        -null  No events will be made available.
Available format types are:
filter - SpecTcl filter format files.                    <co id='plugin_attnosample' />
jumbo - NSCL 'standard' buffer format with jumbo sized buffers
nscl - NSCL 'standard' buffer format decoder'

            One of the interesting things about plugins is that they can
            be distributed by only supplying their package index file and
            their shared library.  That can be put in a Tarball and
            handed off to any user.  This is the advantage of using the
            Tcl stubs library as you are insulated from the need to know
            the specific version of Tcl SpecTcl was linked against.

        <para>
            To install a plugin so that it's automatically available to all
            SpecTcl users, you can ask your system administrator to
            install the plugin in a directory under the
            <filename>TclLibs</filename> subdirectory of the Tcl
            installation.
