<p>
    The tree parameter package provides the ability to bind variable like objects
    to SpecTcl parameters and to Tcl variables.  The tree nature comes from
    the fact that periods in object names serve as path separators that define
    a tree of objects as seen by the graphical user interface software.
</p>
<p>
    The original version of treeparameter was written by Daniel Bazin of the NSCL.
    Since it was contributed it has been completely rewritten.  The graphical
    user interface provided by Daniel Bazin has also been completely rewritten
    and extended to include a modern object browser interface that can be used
    at the option of the SpecTcl user.
</p>
<p>
    The advantages to using the tree parameter package are:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Decouples the user code from parameter numbers making it easier
            to pass parameters between <a href='eventprocessor.htm'>event processors</a>
            in a single event pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
            Associates metadata with parameters and variables which
            supports a kinder gentler way to create Spectra.
        </li>
        <li>
            Provides a simple method to bind C++ variable like objects to
            Tcl variables and hence make it easy to steer the computations
            performed by event processors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Provides support for a hierarchical view of parameter and variable
            space that is more natural for large experiments.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3 id='ctreeparameter'>Main features of <tt>CTreeParameter</tt></h3>

<p>
  There are basically two ways to create a tree parameter object.
  <ol>
    <li>You can fully construct the parameter</li>
    <li>You can use a two phase construction where you construct and the
        later initialize the parameter.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Once constructed a tree parameter can be treated as a C+++ double variable.
    Tree parameters also have additional methods you can call.  Futhermore,
    a <a href='#treeparamarray'>CTreeParameterArray</a> allows youto bundle
    a set of tree parameters into an indexable object.
</p>
<p>
    Tree parameters have the following properties (metadata)>
    <ul>
        <li>A name that, when the parameter is bound is used to locate and
            bind this parameter to a corresponding SpecTcl parameter object.
        </li>
        <li>Units of measure associated with the tree parameter.  The
            GUI uses this to annotate the axis of a spectrum involving
            a tree parameter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Low and high limits that are used by the GUI as default axis
            limits when createing a spectrum.
        </li>
        <li>
            channels used to determine the default binning of a channel.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>
    The <tt>CTreeParameter</tt> constructors have the following signatures:
</p>
<pre>
CTreeParameter()
CTreeParameter(std::string name, const CTreeParameter& Template)
CTreeParameter(const CTreeParameter& rhs)

CTreeParameter(std::string name)
CTreeParameter(std::string name, std::string units)
CTreeParameter(std::string name, double lowLimit, double highLimit, 
               std::string units)
CTreeParameter(std::string name, UInt_t channels, 
               double lowLimit, double highLimit, std::string units)
CTreeParameter(std::string name, UInt_t resolution)
CTreeParameter(std::string name, UInt_t resolution, 
               double lowLimit, double widthOrHigh, 
               std::string units, bool widthOrHighGiven)

</pre>

<p>
    The first three of these constructors are special:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>The first one, the default
    constructor creates a tree parameter that has default lmits and channel count
    but does not have a name and therefore does not have a parameter binding.
    Normally a tree parameter that is constructed in this way will have a later
    <tt>Initialize</tt> call done to complete initialization..
   </li>
   <li>
    The second one takes an existing tree parameter and creates a duplicate that
    has a different name and therefore will be bound to a different SpecTcl
    parameter.
   </li>
   <li>
    The final one is a copy constructor.  This is normally used to support
    pass by value semantics to functions and methods and is not normally used
    by user level code.
   </li>
</ol>

The remaining constructors create a fully initialized tree parameter with zero'
or more attributes taking default values.  The <tt>name</tt> parameter is the
name of the tree parameter and determines which SpecTcl parameter this object
will be bound to.

<ul>
    <li>
        <tt>units</tt> is metadata defining the units of measure for the parameter.
        This defaults to an empty string in constrcutors that don't provide this
        parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt>lowLimit</tt> is the recommended low limit of a spectrrum axis for
         this parameter.  This defaults to 1.0 for constructors that don't
         provide this parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt>highLimit</tt> is the recommended high limit of the spetrum axis
        for this parameter.  This defaults to 100.0
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt>channels</tt> is the recommended number of channels on an axis
        for this parameter.  This defaults to 100
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt>resolution</tt>When provided, this set the number of channels
        to 2<sup>n</sup>.  If the constructor does not supply
        <tt>lowLimit</tt> and <tt>highLimit</tt> these but does supply
        <tt>resolution</tt> the spectrum limits will be set to
        [0, 2<sup>n</sup>-1].
    </li>
    <li><tt>widthOrHigh</tt> and <tt>widthOrHighGiven</tt>.  When these are provided,
        <tt>widthOrHighGiven</tt> determines the meaning of the
        <tt>widthOrHigh</tt> parameter.
        If <tt>true</tt> <tt>witdthOrHighGiven</tt> is the recommended high
        value for the parameter axis, while if <tt>false</tt>, it is the width of a
        channel, which sets the high limit to <tt>lowLimit + widthorHigh*channels</tt>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After constrruction, the <tt>Initialize</tt> method can be called to
    initialize or re-initialize the attributes of the tree parameter.
    Normally this is done after a default construction or by the
    <tt>treeparmaeter</tt> command to change the definition of a parameter.
</p>
<p>
    The Initialize method is heavily overloaded including the following
    method signatures:
</p>
<pre>
void Initialize(std::string name, UInt_t resolution);
void Initialize(std::string name, UInt_t resolution, 
                double lowLimit, double highOrWidth, std::string units, 
                bool highOrWidthGiven);
void Initialize(std::string name);
void Initialize(std::string name, std::string units);
void Initialize(std::string name, UInt_t channels, 
                double lowLimit, double highLimit, std::string units);    
</pre>
<p>
    The parameters have the same meaning as for the constructors.
</p>

<p>
    Once constructed the methods support all of the arithmetic operators any
    other double supports.  The following are some additional special members
    that a tree parameter supports.  An incomplete listing follows and
    <tt>CTreeParameter.h</tt> can be looked at to get the full list of public
    methods.
</p>
<pre>
void        Bind();
static void BindParameters();
bool        isBound();
bool        isValid();
void        setInvalid();
void        Reset();
void        clear();
</pre>

<p>
    Tree parameters have to be bound to underlying SpecTcl parameters to function.
    <tt>Bind</tt> connects a tree parameter object to the underlying SpecTcl
    parameter.  <tt>BindParameters</tt> connects all tree parameters that have been
    defined to underlying SpecTcl parameters.  In both cases, if a SpecTcl parameter
    has not been defined this method creates a new one.  <tt>isBound</tt> returns
    <tt>true</tt> if the tree parameter object has been bound.
    Multiple tree parameters with the same name will bind to the same SpecTcl
    parameter.  This is supported and not considered an error.
</p>
<p>
    <tt>isValid</tt> is only usable when the tree parameter is bound and in a
    <tt>operator()</tt> method of an event processor.  It returns the
    <tt>true</tt> if the underlying SpecTcl parameter has had a value assigned to it.
    The underlying parameter's validity is checked so this method will return
    the right answer regardless of whether or not this tree parameter, another tree
    parameter or even a direct assignment to the underlying <tt>rEvent</tt>
    element was made.   <tt>setInvalid</tt> clears the valid flag.  This
    can be used if you have set a preliminary value for the parameter but
    your code later determines it does not want to commit that value.
    This must be used with care as no effort can be made to set parameters
    that were computed that depended on this prior to the <tt>setInvalid</tt>
    call.
</p>
    <tt>Reset</tt> is a synonym for <tt>setInvalid</tt> in the original
    version of the tree parameter package, this also set a shadow copy of the
    actual parameter so a known value.  There are no shadow copies however
    in this version of the package.  <tt>Reset</tt> is only provided for
    the sake of compatibility.  Similarly <tt>clear</tt> is also a synonym
    for <tt>setInvalid</tt> and is only provided for the sake of compatibility.
</p>


<h3 id='treeparamarray'>Tree parameter arrays</h3>

<p>
    Often in high channel count detectors you want to represent parameters that
    represent arrays of channels that are similar in nature but distinct in name.
    For example the strips on a Si strip detector, or the pads in a drift chamber.
    Tree parameter arrays allow you to create a set of tree parameters that
    can be indexed using the standard C/C++ <tt>[n]</tt> notation.  Tree parameter
    arrays take a base paramter name and create an array of parameters with names
    like <tt>basename.00 basename.01...</tt> (an appropriate number of
    digits are used so that an alphabetical sort of the parametesrs will
    give these in index order).
</p>

<p>
    Tree parameters also support one or two phase construction.  The
    class that implements tree parameters is called <tt>CTreeParameterArray</tt>.
    The method signatures you'll need to be aware of are:
</p>
<pre>
  CTreeParameterArray();
  CTreeParameterArray(std::string baseName, 
		      UInt_t resolution, UInt_t numElements, Int_t baseIndex);
  CTreeParameterArray(std::string baseName, 
		      UInt_t resolution, 
		      double lowLimit, double highOrWidth, 
		      std::string units, bool widthOrHighGiven, 
		      UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);
  CTreeParameterArray(std::string baseName, UInt_t elements, Int_t baseIndex);
  CTreeParameterArray(std::string baseName, std::string units, 
		      UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);
  CTreeParameterArray(std::string baseName, 
		      double low, double high, std::string units, 
		      UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);
  CTreeParameterArray(std::string baseName, UInt_t channels, 
		      double low, double high, std::stringunits, 
		      UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);

  CTreeParameter&amp; operator[](Int_t nIndex);

  void Initialize(std::string baseName, UInt_t resolution, 
		  UInt_t elements, Int_t baseIndex);
  void Initialize(std::string baseName, UInt_t resolution, 
		  double lowLimit, double widthOrHeight,
		  std::string units, bool widthOrHeightGiven, 
		  UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);
  void Initialize(std::string baseName, UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);
  void Initialize(std::string baseName, std::string units, UInt_t elements, 
		  Int_t firstIndex);
  void Initialize(std::string baseName, double lowLimit, double highLimit, 
		  std::string units, UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);
  void Initialize(std::string baseName, UInt_t channels, 
		  double lowLimit, double highLimit, std::string units, 
		  UInt_t elements, Int_t firstIndex);


  void Reset();
  std::vector&lt;CTreeParameter*&gt;::iterator begin();
  std::vector&lt;CTreeParameter*&gt;::iterator end();
  UInt_t size();
  Int_t lowIndex();
  
  CTreeParameter&amp; operator[](Int_t nIndex);
    
</pre>

<p>
    The constructors and Initialize family of methods function in the same
    way as the constructors for <a href='#param'>CTreeParameter</a>
    The additiona parameters <tt>elements</tt> and <tt>baseIndex</tt>
    set the number of elements and the value of the first index.
    <tt>baseIndex</tt> defaults to zero to match the expectations of a
    C/C++ array.
</p>
<p>
    <tt>Reset</tt> invokes <tt>Reset</tt> on all of the parameters in the
    array.  <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> provide STL like iteration within
    the array (with this form of iteration you can visit all elements without
    needing to know how many elements there are or what the base index
    value is).  Similarly, <tt>size</tt> returns the number of elements in the
    array, and <tt>lowIndex</tt> the first legal index.
</p>
<p>
    The implementation of <tt>operator[]</tt> supports indexing for both
    lvalues and rvalues (an lvalue is something that can be modified the name
    comes from the fact that lvalues can appear on the left side of the
    <tt>=</tt> operator.   An rvalue cannot be modified in an expression
    (must appear only on the right side of an assignment.
    If this is confusing the executive summary is that given two tree parameter
    arrays named <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> and expression like:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    a[i] = b[j]
    
</pre>
    is perfectly legal.
</p>

<h3 id='treeparamstructs'>Structures of tree parameters and arrays.</h3>
<p>
    One point of tree parameters and tree arrays is to be able to impose a structure
    on top of the <tt>rEvent</tt> array that event processor <tt>operator()</tt> methods
    get.  Prior to calling <tt>operator()</tt>, SpecTcl binds the current <tt>rEvent</tt>
    array to the defined tree parameters so that gets and sets to tree parameters get
    and set the corresponding <tt>rEvent</tt> member.
</p>
<p>
    The biggest issue in using a struct of tree parameters is getting them
    properly constructed.   You might think that code like the example below
    would work:
</p>
<pre>
    struct Something {
        CTreeParameter a;
        CTreeParameter b;
        CTreeParameterArray c;
    }
    struct Something = {...};  // Constructors in the {}'s
</pre>
<p>
    In fact what this does is not well defined in the C++ standard and for
    the compilers we use it does not work.
</p>
<p>
    What you can do is use the fact that structs in C++ are just classes where
    all methods and data are public.  Specifically, you can define
    a constructor for a class.   You can also use two phase construction of
    the tree parameters themselves to define elements to be as you want them to be:
    Consider the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    struct Something {
        CTreeParameter      a;
        CTreeParameter      b;
        CTreeParameterArray c;
        
        Something(std::string basename) {
            a.Initialize(basename + ".a");
            b.Initialize(basename + ".b");
            c.Initialize(basename + ".c", 16, 0);
        }
    };
    
    struct MyTree {
        Something thing1;
        Something thing2;
        
        MyTree(std::string basename) :
            thing1(basename + ".thing1"), thing2(basename + ".thing2") {}
    }
    
    MyTree aTree("tree");
    
</pre>
<p>
    The end effect of this code is to create a tree with the following shape and
    names:
</p>
<pre>
    aTree
       +--&gt; thing1
                 +---&gt; a ("tree.thing1.a")
                 +---&gt; b ("tree.thing1.b")
                 +---&gt; c ("tree.thing1.c.00" - "tree.thing1.c.15")
                        +-&gt; [0]
                         ...
                        +-&gt; [15]
       +--&gt; thing2
          ...
</pre>
<p>
    For example <tt>aTree.thing2.c[5]</tt> referenced in the <tt>operator()</tt>
    method of an event processor is the SpecTcl parameter named
    <tt>tree.thing2.c.05</tt>. Naturally in many cases you will use a more complex
    version of the <tt>Initialize</tt> method to specify the units and range
    of values held by each parameter.
</p>

<h2 id='vars'>Tree variable objects.</h2>

<p>
    Sometimes it is convenient to be able to modify the computations performed
    by your event processors without recompiling them.  One way  to do this
    is to define a set of Tcl variables, have your event processor read those
    variables (or bind them to C/C++ variables) and modify how they operate
    based on the values of those variables.
</p>
<p>
    While it is possible to use the Tcl API or the C++ encapsulation of the
    API SpecTcl provides to accomplish this, Tree variables provide a simpler
    method as well as a way to document what the values of the Tcl variables
    mean.  In the end a tree variable is just a Tcl variable with metadata
    that is held by the tree parameter object and a naming convention that,
    like tree parameters specifies that <tt>.</tt> is a path separator
    in some set of variable trees.
</p>
<p>
    The tree variable package provides <a href="#treevararrays">arrays</a>
    as well as single value.  The arrays, however map to sets of Tcl variables
    rather than elements of Tcl arrays.
</p>
<p>
    This section will describe:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href='#treevars'>How to create and use tree variables</a></li>
    <li><a href='#treevararrays'>How to create and use tree variable arrays</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The method described for <a href='#treeparamstructs'>making structures
    from tree parameters</a> should be used for tree variables as well to
    organize and construct instances of structures of tree variables.
</p>

<h3 id='treevars'>Creating and Using Tree Variables</h3>
<p>
    Like tree parameters, tree variables support one or two stage construction
    by having a default constructor and an
    <tt>Initialize</tt> method as well as a method to do full construction:
</p>
<pre>
  CTreeVariable();
  CTreeVariable(std::string name, double value, std::string units);
  void Initialize(std::string name, double value, std::string units);
</pre>
<p>
    The <tt>name</tt> parameter is the name of the Tcl variable that
    will be bound to the tree variable.  <tt>value</tt> is the intial value
    that will be given to the tree variable.  The <tt>units</tt> are units
    of measure that are supplied for documentation purposes only.
</p>
<p>
    Once constructed a tree variable can be treated like any other <tt>double</tt>
    variable in an expression.  All arithmetic operators and are supported as well
    as conversion to and from <tt>double</tt> variables/values.
    A few other methods are supported besides the methods and operators required
    to make the variable masquerade successsfully as a <tt>double</tt>. See
    <tt>TreeVariable.h</tt> for a full definition of this class.  The common
    methods are:
</p>
<pre>
  std::string getUnit();
  bool        hasChanged();
  bool        valueChanged();
  void        resetChanged();    
</pre>
<p>
    <tt>getUnit</tt> returns the units of measure that have been associated with the
    object. <tt>hasChanged</tt> returns <tt>true</tt> if the value of the units
    for the object have changed.  The units can change because <tt>Initialize</tt>
    can be called more than once. <tt>valueChanged</tt> is <tt>true</tt> if the
    value of the tree variable has changed since the last <tt>resetChanged</tt>
    which resets both the change flag for value and for metadata. A call to
    <tt>resetChanged</tt> will also fire any traces associated with the Tcl variable.
    Note that traces are set by  Tcl widgets that track variable values to know
    when it is necessary to update their appearance.
</p>
<p>
     Note that if more than one tree variable has the same name both are mapped
     to the same Tcl variable.  The most recent units settting affects both
     variables as do value sets:
</p>
<pre>
    CTreeVariable a("a.tree.variable", 0.0,"furlongs/fortnight"); // [1]
    a = 3.14159;                                                  // [2]
    ..
    
    CTreeVariable anotherA("a.tree.variable", 5, "m/sec^2");      // [3]
    
</pre>
<p>
    At [1], the Tcl variable a.tree.variable has the value 0.0 and
    <tt>a.getUnits()</tt> will return <tt>furlongs/fortnight</tt>.
    At [2], the units are unchanged, but the value of a and the Tcl
    variable <tt>a.tree.variable</tt> is approximately &pi;.
    At [3], <tt>a, anotherA</tt> and the Tcl variable
    <tt>a.tree.variable</tt> all are 5 and for <tt>a</tt> and
    <tt>anotherA</tt>, <tt>getUnits</tt> will return
    <tt>m/sec^2</tt>.
</p>
    
<h3 id='treevararrays'>Creating and Using Tree Variable arrays</h3>

<p>
    As with tree parameters you may want to build indexable sets of tree
    variables the <tt>CTreeVariableArray</tt> class (defined in
    <tt>CTreeVariableArray.h</tt>) provides this functionality.
</p>

<p>
    The constructor/initialization methods are:
    
</p>
<pre>
  CTreeVariableArray();
  CTreeVariableArray(std::string baseName, double initialValue, 
		     std::string units, UInt_t size, int firstIndex = 0);
  CTreeVariableArray(const CTreeVariableArray&amp; rhs);
  void Initialize(std::string baseName, double initialValue, 
		  std::string units, UInt_t size, Int_t firstElement);
</pre>
<p>
    All of the parameters have the same meaning as in the <tt>CTreeVariable</tt>
    constructors/initializers.  In additon <tt>size</tt> specifies the  number
    of elements in the array and <tt>baseName</tt> the value of the lowest
    legal index.  <tt>baseName</tt> is used to construct the names of the
    tree variables in the array in a manner analagous to how this works
    for <tt>CTreeParameterArray</tt>.
<p>
    The other methods are:
</p>
<pre>
  CTreeVariable&amp; operator[](Int_t index);
  CTreeVariableArray&amp; operator=(const CTreeVariableArray&amp; rhs);
  
  UInt_t size();
  Int_t  firstIndex();
</pre>
<p>
    The implementation of <tt>operator[]</tt> allows you to index on both the
    left and right side of an <tt>=</tt>.  The <tt>operator=</tt> allows
    you to assign the values from one array to another if they are the
    same size.  <tt>size</tt> tells you how many elements an array has
    and <tt>firstIndex</tt> the lowest legal index value.
