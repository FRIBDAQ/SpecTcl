    Buffer Decoders are objects SpecTcl uses to understand the outer layers of
    data from a data source.  Typically the outer layers of the way a data
    acquisition system packages data are experiment independent.  The Buffer
    Decoder for a data source knows how to look at this and farm out chunks of
    data to the Analyzer which in turn knows how to parcel out data to the
    elements of the event processing pipeline.
</p>
<p>
    All buffer decoders supply a base set of services that are defined by the
    <tt>CBufferDecoder</tt> base class (see <tt>BufferDecoder.h</tt>).  Specific
    buffer decoders may provide additional services if appropriate.  You can (and should) use
    the C++ <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> operator to determine if the buffer decoder
    passsed in to your event processor is a specify buffer decoder type before
    making use of these additional services.

</ul>
<p>
    Writing and installing your own buffer decoders is beyond the scope of this
    documentation, however it is possible.  Ask for help if you want to do this
    (for data taken outside the NSCL for example).
</p>

<h2 id="basedecoder">Services all buffer decoders must offer</h2>
<p>
    The following pure virtual methods in <tt>CBufferDecoder</tt> define the
    services all buffer decoders must supply:
</p>
<pre>
  virtual const Address_t getBody() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getBodySize() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getRun() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getEntityCount() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getSequenceNo() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getLamCount() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getPatternCount() = 0;
  virtual UInt_t getBufferType() = 0;
  virtual void getByteOrder(Short_t&amp; Signature16,
			    Int_t&amp; Signature32) = 0;
  virtual BufferTranslator* getBufferTranslator(); 
  virtual std::string getTitle() = 0;
</pre>

<p>
    The buffer decoder can be thought of as breaking its input up into chunks
    data.  These chunks can have format specific headers.  The
    <tt>getBody</tt> method will return a pointer to the first byte after the
    header.  <tt>getBodySize</tt> returns the number of bytes in the body of
    a chunk.  Chunks may be further sub-divided into entities. For example
    a bufferd data acquisition system may fit several events into a buffer.
    <tt>getEntityCount</tt> returns the number of distinct entities in a
    chunk.
</p>
<p>
    Most data acquisition systems have the ability to divide data taking up
    into segments.  These segments are normally called runs.  Data acquisition
    systems may also associated meta-data with each run.  SpecTcl assumes that
    this meta-datam may include a run number and a title.  The run number is
    a unique number normally assigned by the data acquisition system while the
    title is free form descriptive text that the users type in to help them
    associate run numbers with the purpose of the run.
    <tt>getRun</tt> returns the run number while <tt>getTitle</tt> returns
    the run title string

</p>
<p>
    The <tt>getByteOrder</tt> method returns two byte order signatures that help
    you understand the differences between the byte order of the system that
    produced the data and the system SpecTcl is running on. <tt>Signature16</tt>
    is an output parameter that will contain the pattern <tt>0x0102</tt> in the
    native byte order of the data source while <tt>Signature32</tt> will
    contain <tt>0x01020304</tt> in the native byte order of the system that
    created the data.  Normally you won't need to call this.  Instead,
    for each buffer, buffer decoders make use of the base class functionality
    to ensure that <tt>getBufferTranslator</tt> returns the correct translator
    object pointer and you can then use that to construct a
    <tt>TranslatorPointer</tt> object to transparently perform byte order
    adjustments for you.
</p>
<p>
    The other item getters are fairly specific to older experiments in NSCLDAQ.
    Most buffer decoders can just return 0 for them.  <tt>getLamCount</tt>
    dates back to CAMAC days and provides the number of lam masks that may be
    at the front of a physics trigger event body.  Similarly <tt>getPatternCount</tt>
    will provide the number of pattern (hit) registers that might be at the beginning
    of the body of a physics event.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly most data sources have the concept of a data type.  <tt>getBufferType</tt>
    returns the type of the chunk.  <tt>buftypes.h</tt> defines the types you should
    return for 'normal' items.  Other buffer types will be sent to the
    <tt>OnOther</tt> processing path and event processors that care need to know
    how to either recognize and deal with them or ignore them.
</p>

<h2 id='nscldecoder'>NSCL Buffer decoder data prior to NSCLDAQ 10.0</h2>
<p>
    The <tt>CNSCLBufferDecoder</tt> only implements existing interfaces in
    <tt>CBufferDecoder</tt> it does not add anything new.  In most cases
    the methods return values from the buffer header.  In the case of
    e.g. <tt>getTitle</tt> the title from the last state transition is saved
    and returned on demand.
</p>

<h2 id='ringdecoder'>Ring buffer decoder - data more recent than NSCLDAQ-10.0</h2>

<p>
    The <tt>CRingBufferDecoder</tt> class is associated with data sources
    that have <tt>-format=ring</tt>.  At the time this is being written it is
    capable of being a decoder for data from NSCLDAQ 10.x and 11.x.  While the
    decoder attempts to use the contents of the data source itself to determine
    whether to do a 10.x or 11.x decode, the
    <a href='../Commands/ringformat.htm'><tt>ringformat</tt> command</a> can also
    be used to provide a hint.
</p>
<p>
    The Ring buffer decoder provides a few additional methods that allow access
    to the ring item header and the ring body header if present.  To use these,
    however you must be sure you are actually using a ring buffer decoder.  This
    can be done via the <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> operator as shown below.
    <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> uses the RTTI subsystem of the compiler to determine
    if casts of pointers or references are really legitimate.
</p>
<pre>
    // Cast with pointers: dynamic_cast returns null if not valid:
    
    CRingBufferDecoder* pRingDecoder = dynamic_cast&lt;CRingBufferDecoder*&gt;(&amp;rDecoder);
    if (!pRingBufferDecoder) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Decoder is not a CRingBufferDecoder\n;
    }
    
    // Cast with references: dynamic_cast will throw std::bad_cast if not valid.
    
    try {
        CRingBufferDecoder& dynamic_cast&lt;CRingBufferDecoder&&gt;(rDecoder);
        ...
    }
    ...
    catch(std::bad_cast& e) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Decoder is not a CRingBufferDecodder\n"; 
    }
    ...
</pre>

<p>
    Here are the prototypes for ring buffer decoder methods thataccess
    items outside the body of the ring item.
</p>
<pre>
  bool  hasBodyHeader();
  void* getBodyHeaderPointer();
  void* getItemPointer();

</pre>
<p>
    <tt>hasBodyHeader</tt> allows you to test to see if the ring item has a body
    header.  <tt>getBodyHeaderPointer</tt> returns a pointer to a body header
    or a null pointer if the event has no body header. Finally <tt>getItemPointer</tt>
    returns a pointer to the entire ring item.
</p>

<p>
    Since ring buffer data for 10.x differs quite a bit from 11.x the ring
    buffer decoder uses a helper class called a <tt>CRingFormatHelper</tt>
    to help it decodee the two types of data.  The ring buffer decoder uses
    several bits of information to try to choose the correct helper if it can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a <tt>RING_FORMAT</tt> item is see that is used to select the right
        helper.
    </li>
    <li>If a <tt>ringformat</tt> command has been issued that sets the current
         helper.  Normally this should be done prior to <tt>start</tt>.
         The GUI <tt>Data Source</tt> menu entries do that.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ring format helpers can also be programmatically set (e.g. by
        <tt>OnEventSourceOpen</tt> or <tt>OnBegin</tt> methods in event processors).
    </li>
        
</ul>

<p>
    The following are methods in the Ring buffer decoder that allow you to
    influence the process of selecting the ring buffer helper:
</p>
<pre>
  void  setFormatHelper(CRingFormatHelper* pHelper);
  void  setDefaultFormatHelper(CRingFormatHelper* pHelper);
  CRingFormatHelper* getCurrentFormatHelper();
  CRingFormatHelper* getDefaultFormatHelper();
</pre>

<p>
    In all of these methods, <tt>pHelper</tt> must be a pointer to a dynamically
    allocated format helper object.  See
    <a href='#formathelperfactory'>below</a> about how to create those.
    <tt>setFormatHelper</tt> sets the current helper.  This takes effect with the
    next item decoded from the data source, unless the next item is a
    <tt>RING_FORMAT</tt> item in which case that overrides whatever you do.
</p>
<p>
    <tt>setDefaultHelper</tt> sets the helper to use if the decoder is not able
    to figure out what type of ring items to decode.  If this is not set, the
    assumption for SpecTcl-3.4 is that the format is 10.x.  Later versions of
    SpecTcl may change this.
</p>
<p>
    <tt>getCurrentFormatHelper</tt> and <tt>getDefaultFormatHelper</tt>
    return pointers to the format helpers that <tt>setFormatHelper</tt>
    and <tt>setDefaultFormatHelper</tt> set respectively.  Note that
    if a <tt>RING_FORMAT</tt> item is seen, <tt>getCurrentFormatHelper</tt>
    will return a pointer to the format helper appropriate to that
    item.
</p>

<p id='formathelperfactory'>
    You should not directly create format helpers.  This is because SpecTcl
    knows for the set of data formats that are supported which format helper
    to use.  A format helper factory exists that can create the proper format
    helper for you.  You can get a pointer to that factory by using the method
    below:
<pre>
  CRingFormatHelperFactory* getFormatFactory();    
</pre>

<p>
    The <tt>CRingFormatHelperFactory</tt> has the following methods:
</p>
<pre>
    CRingFormatHelper* create(uint32_t major, uint32_t minor);
    CRingFormatHelper* create(void* pFormatItem);
    
    void addCreator(
        uint32_t major, uint32_t minor, const CRingFormatHelperCreator& creator
    );
    void removeCreator(uint32_t major, uint32_t minor);
</pre>

<p>
    Create a format helper using one of the two <tt>create</tt> methods.
    <tt>major</tt> and <tt>minor</tt> are the major and minor versions of the
    version of NSCLDAQ you want to decode data for.  Note that <tt>major</tt>
    must be greater than or equal to <tt>10</tt>.  <tt>pFormatItem</tt>
    is the pointer to a full ring format item (<tt>pFormatitem</tt> should point
    to that items header).  This overload will extract the major and minor
    versions from the item and create the appropriate helper.
</p>
<p>
    You can also extend the set of versions that are supported, though normally
    you do not need to do that.  To do this you need to write a new
    helper (that is beyond the scope of these documents) and register
    the set of versions supported by that helper along with a helper creator
    that knows how to build that kind of helper:
</p>
<pre>
    void addCreator(
        uint32_t major, uint32_t minor, const CRingFormatHelperCreator& creator
    );
</pre>

<p>
    You can also remove support for a version (not clear why you'd want to) by
    via <tt>removeCreator</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    void removeCreator(uint32_t major, uint32_t minor);    
</pre>
