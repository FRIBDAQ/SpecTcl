custom/README

This directory is the default location for adding custom code to TclHttpd.

The custom code location is specified with the -library command line argument or the
Config library <pathname>
configuration file entry.

The server sources everything in this directory in alphabetical order.
This is done by the default "thread main" script, which is by default
bin/httpdthread.tcl
If you run with "-debug 1" you'll get feedback as the code here is loaded.
Otherwise you only see any errors raised during the process.
