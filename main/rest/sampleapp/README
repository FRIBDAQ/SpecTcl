The subdirectories here have code that can be added to tclhttpd
as sample applications.

addnode - this lets you add URLs and annotates for them

bugdb - This is a simple bug database that uses MetaKit. The MetaKit
        library (Mk4tcl) is required to run this application, or you 
	can use Tclkit (which embeds MetaKit).

ddehack - This is a little server that I ran on a Windows box so I
        could control the Netscape running there via DDE.  So, an
        external application (exmh) would poke a URL on tclhttpd,
        which would in turn poke Netscape.

kit_form - support for .frm files, which are forms that keep state
        in a MetaKit database.

login_cookie - demonstrates how to use cookies to maintain login sessions

sendsock - This is really unsafe code.  It is an eval server that
        will let a remote process connect to the server and evaluate
        anything in tclhttpd.

snmp    - this is a MIB-display demo that uses the Scotty Tnm extension

sunscript - this is some very old code from the sunscript.sunlabs.com
        website, which was the first "real" website run with tclhttpd
        back in SunLabs.  Note, it isn't clear that the page format
        templates here still work.
