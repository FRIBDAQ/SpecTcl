httpd.tcl	Sample startup script.  To run a server on port 8015, just do:
	wish httpd.tcl -debug 1
		This should work with any Tcl 8.0 or later wish or tclsh.
		To run on a different port and in the background, try:
	tclsh httpd.tcl -port 80 &
		To try out threads, run with a thread-enabled tclsh and do:
	tclsh httpd.tcl -threads 5
		where this means use up to 5 worker threads.

		httpd.tcl depends on both tclhttpd.rc and httpdthread.tcl,
		as well as the packages in ../lib

tclhttpd.rc	Configuration file with default port, etc.
httpdthread.tcl	Per-thread initialization.

tclhttpd.etc.init
		This is a Solaris startup script:
		/etc/init.d/tclhttpd
		You'd install this and make appropriate symbolic links
		into the various runlevel directories (rc2.d)
		to get the server to start at boot.  The details vary
		among different UNIX's
