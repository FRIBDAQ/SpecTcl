/**
 * @class CAnalysisBase
 *    This class is a base class for analysis that might take place within or
 *    external to SpecTcl but is independent of SpecTcl.  Any interaction with
 *    SpecTcl will have a sample driver event processor that can be used to plug this
 *    class into SpecTcl as well as an offline file reading framework
 *    that can be used to drive identical analysis from file.
 *
 *    This base class is not abstract.  Its methods are virtual but stubs
 *    so that the user only needs to derive and implement the methods they
 *    need.
 *
 *    Interfacing with SpecTcl is also possible by providing a 'client data'
 *    parameter in all of the methods.  The SpecTcl driver can make this pass
 *    e.g. the event pointer....and of course users of the tree parameter framework
 *    can use that to gain access to the data..however reliance on these
 *    methods clearly makes use of this class for ad-hoc offline
 *    analysis unusable.
