   Determine the network address of the peer that we will be talking to.
   this is used prior to a connection to create the sockaddr_in that
   is needed to connect(2).  The port is straightforward as it only needs
   to be converted to network byte ordering.  The host is a bit more interesting.
   - First we try to look it up via gethostbyname(3). If that's successful,
     that's what we use.
   - If the gethostbyname(3) fails, we attempt to treat the hostname as a
     dotted ip string (e.g. "11.22.33.44") and translate it using
     inet_aton(3).
   - If both of the above fail we will throw an exception to indicate the
   network address cannot be computed.  The exception thrown will be a 
   CPortManagerException with the reason ConnectionFailed.
   
   \param result (sockaddr_in& [out]):
       Buffer to hold the resulting network address.
   \throw CPortManagerException
       If the host does not translate.
       
    \note  This could be made a member function, and could cache the
      lookup after doing it once. The assumption is that there will not be
      requent interactions with the server and therefore there's no real penalty
      to looking up the hostname each time we need to connect.
