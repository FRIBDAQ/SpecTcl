/**
 * @class MirrorClient
 *    This class provides a client driven mirror client for the SpecTcl
 *    shared memory mirroring system.  While this is intended to provide
 *    a shared memory mirror it need not do so. The class is policy free
 *    in the sense that it's own client determines where mirrored data goes.
 *    The client is expected to:
 *    - Instantiate this class.
 *    - Request connection to the server (which includes the optional transmission
 *      of a memory information message).
 *    - Request updates, supplying sufficient buffer memory to hold the data.
 *      The assumption is that the client has queried the SpecTcl REST server
 *      about the size of the Spectrum memory and set aside that amount
 *      (in a shared memory or locally) and that this buffer will be used
 *      for all update requests.   The client will indicate if the reply
 *      was a partial or full update.
 *    - When finished destroy the object which, in turn, closes the connection.
 *
 *  This choice of architecture is not only intended to support unit testing
 *  where shared memory is neither needed nor wanted, but unforeseen needs
 *  such as a program somewhere that wants its own internal mirror (e.g.
 *  in the controls world for display memor from the separator SpecTcl(s)).
