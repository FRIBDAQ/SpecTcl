package provide treemenuWidget 1.0

##
#  Provide a snit megawidget that can represent a menu of a tree of names.
#  The hull of this is the top level menu.  This allows the menu to be
#  bound to menubuttons or any other thing that can post it.
#
# OPTIONS:
#   -pullright   - If true, cascades to the next level are pullright in that no click is required
#                  (done by binding <Motion> to postcascade @%y).
#   -items       - A set of items that make up the tree.
#   -splitchar  - The character that splits the levels of the hierarchy (defaults to .).
#   -command     - Script executed when a terminal menu item is finally selected.
#                  This supports the following substitutions:
#                    %W  - The menu widget.
#                    %L  - The label associated with the menu that was clicked.
#                    %N  - The full pathname of the menu item that was clicked e.g
#                     a->b->c might return a.b.c
#
# METHODS
#   post x y   - posts the top level menu at the specified position.
#  
# NOTE:
#  - No assumption is made about parameter names.  Specifically, the menu path is not constructed
#    from the parameter names as that fails for names like "a ".

    #  buildSubMenus
    #    Given a menu and a prefix text adds commands and empty cascades to that menu
    #    based on the names passed in.
    #    *   If a name is not a child of the base name, it is ignored.
    #    *   If a name has no children, it is added as a menu item.
    #    *   If a name has children, it is added as an empty cascade with a command to build the
    #        cascade contents on demand.
    #
    #
    #   This is used because for very large menus it can be time consuming to build the menu
    #   all at once.  This incremental build is very much like the incremental build of the folder
    #   gui.
