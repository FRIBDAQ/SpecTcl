 * \brief The CXamineShMemDisplayImpl class
 *
 * Both CXamine and CSpectraLocalDisplay need to do just about the same thing to
 * implement the CDisplay interface in terms of a CXamineSharedMemory.
 * Basically, they need to translate between SpecTcl-side information and
 * Xamine shared memory information. A lot of this is translation between
 * a SpecTcl-side object and the slot it is associated  with in shared
 * memory. In any case, this implementation class exists so that the CXamine
 * and CSpectraLocalDisplay classes can delegate to an object that implements the
 * common logic.
