/**
 * @class CMirrorCommand
 *     Provides the Tcl 'mirror' command that lists the mirrors
 *     currently being maintained.   The command has the form of an ensemble
 *     in case later capabilities are required.  Currently the subcommands are
 *     only:
 *     -   list ?host-pattern?  lists the mirrors that are maintained
 *          that match the host-pattern (glob).  Note that if omitted,
 *          host_pattern defaults to * which matches all hosts.  The
 *          return from this subcommand is a list of dicts (possibly empty).
 *          Each dict contains the keys
 *          *  host  - the host on which the mirror is being maintained.
 *          *  shmkey - The shared memory key in which the mirror is maintained.
