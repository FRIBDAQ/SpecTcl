           Encapsulates a generalized TCP/IP SOCK_STREAM
           socket. 
             Note that TCP/IP Sockets can come in two flavors:
           Clients and Servers.  Clients must perform a connect,
           while servers perform a bind, listen and then serveral
           accepts to create 'server instances'.
           The state of a socket is maintained in the m_State
           variable and is from the enumerator:
           CSocket::State
           
           Disconnected  - The socket is not connected to anything.
           Bound              - The socket is a server socket which is
                                      not connected, but has been bound to
                                      a service port.
           Listening           - The socket is a server port which is
                                       listening and can therefore accept
                                       connections
           Connected        - The socket is either a client or a 
                                       server instance and is connected
                                       to it's counterpart.

// Synchronization assumptions:
//    the (2) socket calls are recursive (threadsafe).
//    the (3) network database calls are not recursive (notthreadsafe).
//  as such, any calls to (3) network database calls are bracketed with
//  calls to globally synchronize the thread.
/*! \bug Perhaps global syncronization of (3) calls should be conditionalized
         so that this module can be used in a non spectrodaq environment too.

  Operation Type:
    Connection Control
 

Indicates that the socket will be used
as a client socket and attempts to connect it
to a server. 
The address of the server can be
passed in either in IP address or
IP name textual format.  Similarly,
the port can be passed in as a textual
port name (in /etc/services) or a port number.

The action of this function is to convert (if possible) the Host and service 
into numeric equivalents and call the overloaded
Connect(int IpAddress, int service)

Exceptions which can be thrown:

- CTCPBadSocketState -- m_State was not Disconnected
- CTCPNoSuchHost       - Host not in DNS or nonexistent.
- CTCPNoSuchService  - Named service does not translate.
- CTCPConnectionFailed- Connection refused by remote host (from
                        Connect(int IpAddress, int service).

\param host Specifies the system to connect to.  This can be either a DNS
            textual name or a string in dotted IP address format.
\param service Specifies a service offered by the host.  This can be either
               a service name or the textual equivalent of a service number.

On Success the socket state is set to Connected.

Side effects:

The client parameter is 
written with a string representing the

Writes data to the socket.  Note that

           or later call to write(2). Since we'd like to indicate that

           The current assumption is that a followup write will produce
           the same error.  Perhaps the best long term thing to do is to
	   define a CTCPSocketIOError which will include as data the
