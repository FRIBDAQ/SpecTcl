    Purpose:

    This member is called whenever a physics event is
    received.  At least one of the processors in the processing
    pipeline must call the analyzer's SetEventSize() member function.
    This member informs the analyzer how many bytes are in the raw event.
    Other useful members involved in that are:
    IncrementEventSize(int nSize=2)      - Adds to the current event size.
    GetEventSize()                                 - Retrieves the current event size.

    If the function returns kfFALSE, the entire event processing pipeline is
    aborted and the unpacked event being construction is not sent on
    to the event sink.
