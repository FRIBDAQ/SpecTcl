Hi Ron,

I don't think anyone at ornl outside of the physics division is even _aware_ of radware, and that's just fine with me.  So there are no licensing restrictions.  Anyway, most of it was developed even before I came here.

I'd be very happy for you to include it in SpecTcl.

Cheers,
David.

Currently SpecTcl is released into the open source world by the MSU Board of Trustees under the GPL.  Are there licensing issues that ORNL has imposed on this package that I should be aware of? If so what are the licensing/redistribution terms.  If they don't allow incorporation in a separate GPL package, I have the option to distribute as a 'plugin' which would allow the radware software to retain whatever current licensing it may have.
