2.1-008 
	- Incorporate fix for issue 95: parameter -list -byid fails to parse
          the output list for sorting.
        - Incorporate fix for issue 105: sbind usage level help refers to

          values, and log prints are just plain flat lined.
2.1-015 
        - Fix un-numbered defect channel command gets/sets wrong channel

April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 105: sbind Usage level help calls itself the

April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 111 - swrite command creates a file even if no
                    existing spectra have been specified.
May 5, 2004      - Fix little diddly issues with printing and also

June 8, 2004     - Increase spectrum size limits to 2^31.
June 17, 2004    - Defect 131 - There were problems generating the print tick
		   intervals when the axis specifications went in 'reverse'

		   griprint.cc I think.
                 - Fix build issues in TestFiles directory so that the
                   event test generting programs can be built again Yeah.

                   axis mapping information.
	           Fallout from defect 133 discovered and fixed a defect
                   that causes the axis tick computation to DIV0 when
                   mapped axes have decreasing values going away from the
                   origin (e.g. {100 -100 201}).
July 2, 2004     - Defect 132 - Translator pointers are constrained to 
                   natural data boundaries.
                 - Defect 137 - Fix defect introducec by fix of Defect 132:

                   to support unpacking of this module.
August 9, 2004   - Modified colormgr.cc to better deal with systems that
                   have visuals that are not in decent order nor good:
                   Look through all the visuals and choose the true/direct
                   color visual with the most bits, if none exist, then
                   Choose the Pseudo color visual with the most bits.
	           If none of those exist drop back to bitonal.
August 16, 2004 - Fix broken link  to apply.htm in categories.htm documentation
August 17, 2004  - Added the calbrated parameters sources to the mix

September 7, 2004 - Fix error in CEventFilter::setBit... which did not
                    count on there being 8 bits per byte.
September 8, 2004 - Removed in-linedness of CGate::RecursiveReest I had
                    thought this was triggering a compiler error but
                    it was not in fact.  Since this is a virt. there's no
                    gain to inlining it anyway.
September 23,2004 - NamedItem.h - decided to finally trust stl's string
                    constructors.. the way I was doing named item
 	            constructors was giving Purify fits.
September 24,2004 - Added CalibrationDistribution to produce evenly spaced
                    identical peaks.
                  - Added mechanism to fetch the applicatino's test data
                    source so that it can be modified etc.

                    there was a local declaration of a m_pMultiTestSource
                    that masked the member data.:

September 30,2004 - Happy Birthday Ron!! 
                  - Fixed issue 133 Centroids and
	            FWHM not correct for mapped parameters (still).
                  - Made test distributions produce floating point params
                    to make the more flexible.. Gaussian is a symmetric
                    cutoff now.
October   4, 2004 - Added a bit of defensive programming in view of defect
                    149.

                    I just could not stand to look at in fixing defect 133.
October 20,    2004 - Factor acceptgates.cc DrawPoints functions back into
                     the base class where it belongs.  Could not stand to look
	             at it duplicated in 3 different places.
October 20-22    2004 - Fix defect 145: Spaces and special characters in names
                      can make saveall loadall fail miserably...and other misc.
                      things uncovered while repairing the defect.
October 25,26    2004 - Optimize 1d long histogram increments.  Note that many
                      but not all changes will help 2d word increments too, but
                     these (less often used) histograms won't get full benefit
                     as there are modifications to the Spectrum1DL file that
		     are deliberately not propagated back to Spectrum1DW
October 27,      2004 -Optimize2d short histogram increments

November 3,2004 - Fixed position computations on expanded spectra.

          spectra starting with SpecTcl 2.2
                  spectrum if slot # > 999

SpecTcl 3.0: 
      Port to gcc/g++ 3.x:
         o Lots of gruntwork with config.h etc. in all sources.

	   allow the location of Tcl_Channel given it's name.
	    GetChannel
	    GetChannelNames
         o Added CTCLChannel object that can do simple channel operations.
            Read
	    Write
	    atEof
	    Flush
            Close
         o In {Write,Read}Command.cpp  use tcl[io]streams to connect
           swrite/sread to Tcl channel parameters rather than decoding the
	   filename.
      Propagate fix for defect 151 from 2.1 -> 2.2-> 3.0
      
December 28, 2004

        overflow problem in spectra.cc

                and in the classes implemebnting the gates....do this
                by loading the gate mask value into the base class.
  July 19, 2006 Fix error in newGui.tcl. When used with scaler processing,

                >very large< for e.g. cluster file analysis.
  August 16, 2006 Do performance tuning of browser.tcl for 64 bit system.
	        on those systems, treeview find is terribly slow.

               - Filter processor Bugzilla 217 - Put a bit of code in the
               filter event processor to attempt to determine if it has
	       been pointed at something that is not a filter file.
               Seems to work for the cases I've tried, so it's 
 	       certainly better than it was before.
  Oct 16, 2006 - Bugzilla 219 : Added code to TclGrammerApp.cpp to output
	         the VERSION file to tkcon.
               - BZ 220 Allow user to disable prompt for

  Oct 20,2006  - BZ 87 Added basic fitting... still some kinks to work out
                 in the Xamine display but it does work...also need
                 to Xamine drive Gui to create the fit.
  Oct 23, 2006 - Added documentation for the fit command and how to 
                 extend the fitting subsystem.

                 Made fitlines solid lines not just dots.
                 Fixed defect introduced with fitlines - where 1-d objects
                 got deleted on updates.
                 Ensured that fitlines get sent in on sbind. 
                 Added framework for user processing of Xamine buttons in
                 the Xamine custom button box.
