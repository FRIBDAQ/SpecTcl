                    existing spectra have been specified.
May 5, 2004      - Fix little diddly issues with printing and also

	           Fallout from defect 133 discovered and fixed a defect
                   that causes the axis tick computation to DIV0 when
                   mapped axes have decreasing values going away from the
                   origin (e.g. {100 -100 201}).

August 9, 2004   - Modified colormgr.cc to better deal with systems that
                   have visuals that are not in decent order nor good:
                   Look through all the visuals and choose the true/direct
                   color visual with the most bits, if none exist, then
                   Choose the Pseudo color visual with the most bits.
	           If none of those exist drop back to bitonal.
August 16, 2004 - Fix broken link  to apply.htm in categories.htm documentation

September 8, 2004 - Removed in-linedness of CGate::RecursiveReest I had
                    thought this was triggering a compiler error but
                    it was not in fact.  Since this is a virt. there's no
                    gain to inlining it anyway.
September 23,2004 - NamedItem.h - decided to finally trust stl's string
                    constructors.. the way I was doing named item
 	            constructors was giving Purify fits.
September 24,2004 - Added CalibrationDistribution to produce evenly spaced
                    identical peaks.
                  - Added mechanism to fetch the applicatino's test data

September 30,2004 - Happy Birthday Ron!! 
                  - Fixed issue 133 Centroids and
	            FWHM not correct for mapped parameters (still).
                  - Made test distributions produce floating point params
                    to make the more flexible.. Gaussian is a symmetric
                    cutoff now.
October   4, 2004 - Added a bit of defensive programming in view of defect
                    149.

October 20-22    2004 - Fix defect 145: Spaces and special characters in names
                      can make saveall loadall fail miserably...and other misc.
                      things uncovered while repairing the defect.
October 25,26    2004 - Optimize 1d long histogram increments.  Note that many
                      but not all changes will help 2d word increments too, but
                     these (less often used) histograms won't get full benefit
                     as there are modifications to the Spectrum1DL file that
		     are deliberately not propagated back to Spectrum1DW
October 27,      2004 -Optimize2d short histogram increments

November 3,2004 - Fixed position computations on expanded spectra.

          spectra starting with SpecTcl 2.2
                  spectrum if slot # > 999

SpecTcl 3.0: 
      Port to gcc/g++ 3.x:

	    atEof
	    Flush
            Close

  August 8, 2006 Enhancement 194 - increase precision in output of 
                 integrations.
  August 15,2006 Enhancement 205 - Limited the length of the attach spec on the
                GUI status line to at most 50 chars with the middle ones
                replaced by ...  this prevents the window from becoming
                >very large< for e.g. cluster file analysis.
  August 16, 2006 Do performance tuning of browser.tcl for 64 bit system.
	        on those systems, treeview find is terribly slow.

               to support a selective store.
               - Filter processor Bugzilla 217 - Put a bit of code in the
               filter event processor to attempt to determine if it has
	       been pointed at something that is not a filter file.
               Seems to work for the cases I've tried, so it's 
 	       certainly better than it was before.
  Oct 16, 2006 - Bugzilla 219 : Added code to TclGrammerApp.cpp to output
	         the VERSION file to tkcon.
               - BZ 220 Allow user to disable prompt for

		use the source spectrum axis definitions to provide the
		appropriate axis def for the new spectrum.
December 7, 2006 
               - Fix 2 defects:
                 o Removing fits from xamine via SpecTcl failed due to 
                   not allowing that 'gate type' to be recognized for 
                   deletion.
                 o Deleting a spectrum should delete all fits that are
                   defined on that spectrum.
December 19, 2006 
               - Fix defect per D. Caussyn FSU: CXdrInputStream.cpp was

January 18, 2007 - Defect 288 : applygate.tcl did not handle case of
			multiple target spectra correctly.
February 12, 2007 - Enh Request 232 : when treevariable -set is invoked,
		 fire the traces on that variable so that any GUI elements
		bound to that treevariable are updated
February 13, 2007 - Defect/enh. 234 : When a configuration is restored,
                and the config script has an error, keep on trying to
		execute the script but report all the errors in a dialog...
		at present, hopefully there are not very many errors as
		the dialog is not a scrolling dialog.
February 15,2007 - Synch gpVersion with VERSION symbol in config.h
Week of Feb 22, 2007 - BZ enhancement request 291 Gamma 2d deluxe 
                 spectrum.
Week of Feb 26, 2007 - BZ 292?  Ensure that tk app name is unique
                so multiple tkcons will open.
               - Fix inadvertent leaving of Gamma 2d as Ulong_t not
                 UInt_t and same for gamma deluxe, for 3.1 , Gamma 2dL
                 was already correct.
Week of March 5 - Add Splash screen.
                - Adjust chisquare calculation to be correct for CGaussianFit 
		  (thanks to Dirk Weisshaar).
Week of March 12, 2007-
	- Ensure that SpecTcl does not crash if VERSION not readable.
	  (BZ 294).
Week of March 19, 2007
        - Make CEvent::clear() O(1) time.bg
Week of April 2, 2007
        - Add disclaimer to filterread.htm about data beyond the last used
          position in filter buffers as someone made an assumption that is not
          true about it.
        - Added whatsnew3.1.htm page linked to front page that allows
          users to see what's new in SpecTcl 3.1

Pre-released April 26, 2007

Pre-3.
 
Week of April 30, 2007
        - Added observer capability to all dictionaries types.  This will
          allow support of traces on e.g. spectrum dictionary.
        - Added tests for dictionary observers and the observer manager
          helper classes.
        - Added capability to add/remove observers from the spectrum dictionary
          to CHistogrammer.
        - Added API entries to add/remove spectrum observers.
        - Added spectrum -trace command.
        - Added docs for the -trace command.
        - Made Xamine's Xamine_DrawFittedString also attempt truncation
          rather than just leaving a string blank if it does not fit.
          e.g. a title that is:
          "this is a very long string that does not fit"
          could get rendered/displayed as:
          "this is a very lo..."  if that's all the room there is
        - Port in the jumbo buffer decoder and put it in scriptable unpacker
            too
Week of May 7, 2007
        - BZ 295 - add support for splitting/joining filter files.  Note that
          cat can join perfectly well, so this reduces to writing a program
	  filtsplit that can split.  We'll choose to write:
		filtspilt --size blocks_per_file --output stem_name  input_file
          blocks_per_file - number of input filter blocks per output file.
          stem_name       - Is the stem of the split output files which 
                            will have names like stem_name_nnn.flt
          input_file      - Is the input file to split.
       - Changed swrite format level to 3: Make NSCLAsciiFormatter able to read:
         rev 2,1 and even 2 where summary spectra only have 1 coord.
       - Fix some issues with Gamma Delux 2d spectrum classes that don't compile
         on 4.x compilers
       - get NSCLAsciiFormatter to properly read rev 2,3 and 'malformed rev2'
         produced by the pre2 version of 3.2.
       - Make the spectrum file read functions able to correctly report errors in
         reads (e.g. not a spectrum file).
Week of May 14, 2007
       - BZ 297 - Make axis tick marks draw correctly if there's only one channel in 
        the spectrum (well really just don't draw tick marks at all.
       - Add code to support gate observers.. for new displayer.
       - Add -trace subcommand to gate.
       - Fix error in TreeParameter/SpectrumGenerator.tcl -state normal not
          -state enabled.
       - Fix error in TreeParameter/SpectrumGenerator.tcl - Duplicate button
         did not correctly decode parameters of spectrum being duplicated.
       - Add docs for the gate -trace subcommand to the web docs.
       - Fix CNSCLJumboBuffer::size32() member, was not correctly picking up 
         the buffer revision level.
Week of May 24, 2007
       - Only clear gates that are worth clearing.
Week of May 28,l 2007
       - Fix channel position to pixel position coversions which had
         the width of a channel to be too large (too few channels in displayed
         range.
       - Do some jiggerypokery with 1-d gates to make them more consistent with
         their integration:
         o On acceptance the right point is adjusted to the right by a channel.
         o Gate checking is now exclusive of the right point.
         o On entering in the display the adjustment is un-done so that
           Xamine will display correctly.
 Week of June 4, 2007
       - Ensure that Xamine's SuperPrompt::SetList message boxes
         from Xamine_error_msg() get displayed by making them
         children of the prompter's parent rather than of the prompter
         which, after all is hidden.
 Week of June 11, 2007
       - Get nice support for ubuntu edgy eft.
 Week of June 25, 2007
       - Begin adding the 'integrate' command.
 Week of July 2, 2007
       - 2-d integrations in Xamine had displayed standard deviations not
         fwhm's as advertised.
       - Add docs for integrate command.
Week of July 9, 2007
       - Corrected CPacket.cpp for jumbos in scriptable.
Week of August 13, 2007
       - BZ 318 - Old GUI SpectrumGenerator.tcl was not listing  applied
         gates correctly when the filter mask was not *
Week of Sept 10,2007
       - BZ 318 revisited... need to use hash tables for the applied gates
         rather than lists to be utterly reliable.
       - Fix error in gamma 2d deluxe where if only one y parameter was specified
         one of the constructors would segfault because it was mistakenly getting units
         from y[1] not y[0].
       - Fix error in swrite NSCLAsciiSpectrumFormatter...get axis limits directly from the
         spectrum description rather than dorking around to get them from
         the converter.
Pre3 released

October 11, 2007 Pre 4 (or possibly 3.2-001) opened.

October 12, 2007 - Make multicolored monster understand Gamman deluxe spectra.
October 15, 2007 - Redid a bunch of stuff with the test data sources to 
            allow attach, re-attach , re-re attach etc.  Don't think there
            are any memory leaks.
October 23, 2007 - Add detach menu entry.. really stops processing and does an
                   attach -file /dev/null 
                 - added version specific daq locations to search path for
                   spectcldaq (gui).

November  6, 2007 - Convert to svn repository
November 26, 2007 - BZ 327 - Fix multicolored monster problems with changing spectra
                    in resopnse to tree parameter range changes.
December 4,2007   - Correct the Usage member of the calibration fit command so that
                    it reflects the change in the name of the command.

January 3, 2008   - Install splash/license.terms -> $(prefix)/splash.license
                    to comply with its license terms.
Finalized Pre-release 4 January 3, 2008

Start edit level 3.2-pre5 (may change to 3.2-001 midstream.. watch the log below).
January 7, 2008   - Fixed include license.terms in the build.
                  - GUI Attach -pipe was failing due to attempts to set
                    the value of the buffersize widget prior to the creation
                    of that widget's spinbox.
January 9, 2008   - Add needParameter virtual to CSpectrum class hierarchy.
                    this is used to know which list spectra belong in.
January 10, 2008  - Fix errors in 1d construction.
          	  - Use spectra organized by parameter to make
                    increments a bit more efficent.
		  - Use observers to maintain the flattened gate lists
                    so there's no increment time overhead.
January 11, 2008 - Make CFlattenedGateList work even if the gate container
                   for the gate has changed from the inserted one.. 
                   that is match the name.
January 16, 2008 - Separate filter output formatting from the filter
                   class itself.
January 17, 2008 - Provide extensible filter format structure.
                 - Fix error in filter save in gui .. parameter list had
		   an extra layer of {}'s.
                 - Add ability to introspect filter format.
January 18, 2008 - Added support for the newer spectrum types to the API
                 - Added filter support to the API.
January 25, 2008 - Debugged filter support API
                 - Fixed error in gate flattener handling that was preventing
                   gate from being properly applied.
February 25,2008 - Work around lesstif file dialog bug..For each re-use of the file selection
                   dialog, explicitly set the search mask to the dirname of the  mask with
                   *.win appended.  lesstif has the tendency to store the selected file
                   in the filter path.
March 12, 2008   - Cosmetic changes to folder gui file menu and the prompter for the 
                   which gui to use dialog.
March 21, 2008   - Fix error in MCM GUI where parameters with empty units could cause
                   errors in the data structures keeping track of the parameters.
                   Specifically, the entries in the units list would collapse out of 
                   that list due to the use of append, rather than lappend to create those lists.
March 24, 2008   - Add spectrum memory usage to status line of folder GUI per Kevin Carnes 
                   suggestion.

March 24,2008 tag release of 3.2
Start work on 3.2-001

March 27, 2008    - Correct error in spectrum observer.  Don't try to enter a spectrum that is
                    not connected to all its parameters.  This can happen in e.g. sread.

March 28, 2008   - BZ330 (hopefully)
                    o Added easy ability to remove callbacks.
                    o Registered all graphical input widgets to call
                      Xamine_DestroyGraphicalInput on both delete and popdown
                    o Have Xamine_DestroyGraphicalInput 
                      * Kill mouse callbacks for graph input.
                      * Remove the callbacks for delete and popdown.

April 1, 2008    - Stop recycling properties dialog so it gets
                   properly recreated (lesstif mis-remanages it).
April 4, 2008    - BZ330 - Don't call cancel callback in
                    Xamine_DestroyGraphicalInput until the callbacks
                    are removed so we avoid recursion that will double
                    destroy the object.
April 22, 2008   - Fix slight errors in binning in SpecTcl.. correctly
                   compute the bin width for the integeristas.
                   Per Thomas Baumann.
May 7, 2008      - Fix defect in Xamine gate acceptor on m2 spectra.
                   Needed to select appropriately between adding the gate
                   and modifying the existing gate, rather than unconditionally
                   adding the gate.. which can throw an uncaught exception.
                   Thanks to Kevin Carnes KSU for stepping into this defect
                   and alerting me to it.
                 - Added Kevin Carnes and Dirk Weisshaar to the acknowledgements.
June 5, 2008     - Fix typeo in BufferAnalysis.h

July 11, 2008    - Gui/slice.tcl - re-init the browser on accepting a gate (reinit member)
                   that restores the parameters used to the list.
                 - Expose the treeview interface to clients of 
                   Gui/browser.tcl
August 18, 2008  - Update to tkcon V2.4
September 17, 2008 
                 - Fixed error in RunState handling.. Set it to
                   "Inactive" on event source EOF.  This is needed to
 		   support batchmode processing of e.g. filter files.

                 - backport capability to integrate superpositions as well
                   as the base spectrum.

Feb 18, 2009    - Xamine button bar background -> black on test installs.
March 18, 2009  - tkcon.tcl - rename clear command to tkconclear so it does not
                  interfere with SpecTcl's clear command.

May 1, 2009     - CSpectrum2Dm.{h,cpp}  Ensure these spectra get put in the
                  don't need a parameter list rather than some need a parameter list
                  which causes them to be grossly underincremented.
May 1, 2009     - Complete a raft of editing so that SpecTcl compiles and runs
                  with minimal error messages on debian lenny...really 
		  Debian g++-4.3.2-1.1
May 20, 2009    - Fix sourcing from new gui.. was stripping newlines from multiline
                  definintions (e.g. psuedos). which caused them to fail.
May 27, 2009    - Fix an error in the handling of contours on gamma spectra

3.2-004
August 13, 2009 - Fix error in Strip chart spectrum was not requiring y parameter
                    - Fix error in strip chart shift.  If shift is larger than spectrum
                    channel count would segfault.that target parameter was defined.
September 4, 2009 - Fix BZ 378 - CHistogrammer::createTitle had typos in the reduction
                    of the y parameter list that led to segfaults when g2d spectra 
                    titles were created.
3.2-005
October 14, 2009 - Fix error in strip chart spectrum.  After a slide left, the
                   offset was off by one causing continuous parameters to have a 
                   1-channel hole in their spectra.
3.2-006
December 3, 2009 - Fix error in XMDialogs.cc XMWarningDialog::XMWarningDialog
                   references the buttons prior to ensuring their creation.
December 4, 2009 - BZ 384 provide a list of fallback fonts in case 
                   adobe courier is missing (e.g. Xming without font pack).
                   If no fonts in the list of fonts are available, do a popup
                   error rather than an stderr message before exiting.
		   BZ384 - Provide a const char* exception handler in main()
                           when caught displays a modal warning box with the
                           exception displayed and when dismissed exits Xamine.
                         - Throw an appropriate const char* exception when
                           no suitable fonts can be found in text.cc:LoadFonts

3.2-007
May 6, 2010   - Remvoe -exact from tkcon's package require of Tcl as
                that fails in ubuntu 10.04.
May 6, 2010  - Update Gri to 3.12.20 and get it to compile on g++-4.3.2
