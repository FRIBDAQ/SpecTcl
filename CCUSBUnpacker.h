/*!
    Unpack data from the CCUSB when it contains a bunch of 
    data from Phillips modules.  All phillips modules are assumed
    to be configured to at least insert a channel hit pattern  and are
    in zero suppressed mode.  This implies that the hit pattern tells us how
    many channels are present in the data.  Each channel includes a channel number tag
    in the top 4 bits that, along with the position of the module in the data stream
    unambiguously determines the channel.

    The parammap command is used to describe the correspondence between
    module/channel and SpecTcl parameters.  We can fetch from this map from the
    parammap command singleton in terms of parameter ids which makes the unpacking
    of a module relatively trivial.

    The format of a single event is:
\verbatim

  +-------------------+
  | event word count  |
  +-------------------+
  |  module 0 hitmask |
  +-------------------+
  | module 0 params   | (will be zero of these if the hitmask is 0).
       ...
  |                   |
  +-------------------+
        ...
  +-------------------+ 
  | module n hitmask  |
  +-------------------+
  | module n params   |
        ...
  |                   |
  +-------------------+

\endverbatim
