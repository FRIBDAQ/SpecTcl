To install this plugin

./configure --prefix=spectclhome
<a bunch of stuff gets printed>
make install

spectclhome is the home directory of a SpecTcl-3.2 installation.

See
./configure --help for other options. The main ones you may need are

--with-spectcl-home=dir

If you want to install the plugin outside of the SpecTcl installation directory,
you can specify that directory with --prefix and the SpecTcl installation directory with 
--with-spectcl-home


--with-tcl-header=dir
   Specifies where the Tcl headers are located.  This is not usually needed.
