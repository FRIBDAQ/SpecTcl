Developing Gri was made easier by suggestions and bug reports from many
users, among whom are: Ivo Alxneit, Karin Bryan, Sara Bennett, Luke
Blaikie, Dave Brickman, Clyde Clements, Pierre Flament, Peter
Galbraith, Dave Hebert, Alejandro López-Valencia, Kawamura Masao, Steve
Matheson, Ed Nather, Carl Osterwisch, Richard Andrew Miles Outerbridge,
Brian May, Jinyu Sheng, Toru Suzuki, Keith Thompson, David Trueman, and
George White. The Gri manual provides a fuller list, and the fact that
it grows monthly is a testament to the power of the open-source
movement.

Throughout Gri development, Peter Galbraith has been a steady
collaborator, supporter, and advisor. Gri would not exist without him.

All of these, and many users with whom I've interacted over the years,
I thank warmly.
