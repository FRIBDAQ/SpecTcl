dnl To link against Tcl, configure does several things to make my life
dnl "easier".
dnl
dnl * maybe ask the user where they think Tcl lives, and try to find it
dnl * maybe ask the user what "tclsh" is called this week (i.e., "tclsh8.0")
dnl * run tclsh, ask it for a path, then run that path through sed
dnl * sanity check its result (many installs are a little broken)
dnl * try to figure out where Tcl is based on this result
dnl * try to guess where the Tcl include files are

dnl Notes from previous incarnations:
dnl > XXX MUST CHECK FOR TCL BEFORE KERBEROS V4 XXX
dnl > This is because some genius at MIT named one of the Kerberos v4
dnl > library functions log().  This of course conflicts with the
dnl > logarithm function in the standard math library, used by Tcl.
dnl
dnl > Checking for Tcl first puts -lm before -lkrb on the library list.
