#   This is run to do the actual make.. It is necessary because
#   at least my version of autotools generate a busted libtool that 
#   must be patched.
#   In particular a string that reads:
#      "lib /OUT:"  must be modified to read "\$AR \$AR_FLAGS"
#
#   This is easily done with sed.
#
#
#  Run this after configure.
