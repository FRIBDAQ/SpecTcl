See INSTALL for generic installation instructions however:

System specific notes notes:

Tru64:  The only compiler supported for SpecTcl at this instant in time 
(SpecTcl-2.1) is g++ version 2.95.1  

E.g. at NSCL, the 2.95.1 compiler is stored in /usr/local/bin so we
export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc
configure ....

When configuring for Tru64 it is necessary to work around a bug in exception 
propagation.  do configure with the --disable-shared switch.



CYGWIN:
 The best way to do this is to just get the cygwin/spectcl installer from 
sourceforge as:

o Tcl/Tk development libs from cygwin.com are broken.
o rpc.h is broken
o libtool is broken
o The cygwin.com system comes with version 3.x of the gcc/g++ compiler which
  is not suported by SpecTcl.


If you do get the cygwin/spectcl installer and need to re-install or you've 
managed to deal with the issues above then:

configure --with-tcl-header-dir=/usr/local/tcl/include \
          --with-tcl-libdir=/usr/local/tcl/lib         \
          --prefix=/usr/opt/spectcl/2.1beta --disable-shared 
fix_libtool
make
make install

Notes:
  - your values for with-tcl-header-dir and with-tcl-libdir may vary 
    depending on where you put the fixed tcl/tk install.
  - your value  for --prefix will also be different.
  - fix_libtool fixes the stupidities in the libtool script wth respect
    to cygwin.  
  - At make time you will get messages like:
     cygpath cannot convert empty path
    you will also get linker info's when Xamine is built.



OS-X: (bash)

  export CXX=/usr/bin/g++2
  export CC=/usr/bin/gcc2
  export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp
  configure --prefix=whatever

  Note that:
   -  prior to running SpecTcl, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH must point to /sw/lib
   -  Evidently libtool will not make shared libs.
