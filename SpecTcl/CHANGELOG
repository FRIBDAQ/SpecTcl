2.1-006 - Incorporate fix 113 - low level cutoffs lead to corrupted
          1-d displays.
        - Have build procedures clean any pre-built Gri prior to 
          tarring up the distribution.

        - Date/time/version stamp installation.
2.1-008 
	- Incorporate fix for issue 95: parameter -list -byid fails to parse
          the output list for sorting.
        - Incorporate fix for issue 105: sbind usage level help refers to

          no valid spectra are included on the command line.
2.1-009 
	- Incorporate printing fixes for last channel of 1-d.
	- Incorporate printinf fix ensure that 2-d spectrum channels display

	  color range.
        - Place upper limits on 1-d graphical entries at the top  of the
	  channel rather than at the bottom.  This more realistically
	  describes what's going on
