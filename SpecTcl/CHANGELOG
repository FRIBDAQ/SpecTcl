January 30,2004  - Updated gri to gri-2.12.7
March 23, 2004   - Issue 97b - Add hierarchical unpacking capability to scripted spectcl.
                             - Also don't require begin run to pick up config.
March 31, 2004   - Added -rpath to contrib/scripted Makefile so that
                   LD_LIBRARY_PATH or ld.so.conf not needed.
April  5, 2004   - Fix issue 118 - low level cutoff display bug.
April 12, 2004   - Extract as many defs as possible from skeleton makefiles
                   to centrally located include files in order to keep the
 	           user makefiles constant.
                 - Use etc not Etc for etcetera stuff.
                 - Add buildstamp
April 13, 2004   - Fix memory leak on delete -all command: Spectrum
                   storage itself is not getting deleted.
                 - Fix lack of error checking on insufficient memory for
                   binding 2d spectrum (can segfault).
April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 95: parameter -list -byid fails.
April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 105: sbind Usage level help calls itself the
                   bind command which conflicts, of course, with the TCL
                   bind command.
April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 111 - swrite command creates a file even if no
                    existing spectra have been specified.
May 5, 2004      - Fix little diddly issues with printing and also
                   Put right limit at the top of a channel rather than the
                   left side of a channel.
                 - Fix ISSUE 118 superpositions in window files are written
	           as id's not as names.
	         - Fix issue 123 superpositions don't print
	         - Fix issue 124 FWHM is not translated to mapped coordinates
	           when spectrum is in mapped mode.
May 12, 2004     - Fix issue 49  
	           Fetching values from ValidValues that are in the
	           invalid state will now throw exceptions 
                 - Fix issue with Display/Makefile that clean leaves behind
                   detritus from flex and bison. (Added MOSTLYCLEANFILES 
                   to Display/Makefile.am).
June 8, 2004     - Increase spectrum size limits to 2^31.
June 17, 2004    - Defect 131 - There were problems generating the print tick
		   intervals when the axis specifications went in 'reverse'
		   (e.g. {100 -100 200}).  Fixed in modifications to
		   griprint.cc I think.
                 - Fix build issues in TestFiles directory so that the
                   event test generting programs can be built again Yeah.
July 1, 2004     - Defect 135 - swrite does not properly preserve the
                   axis mapping information.
	           Fallout from defect 133 discovered and fixed a defect
                   that causes the axis tick computation to DIV0 when
                   mapped axes have decreasing values going away from the
                   origin (e.g. {100 -100 201}).
July 2, 2004     - Defect 132 - Translator pointers are constrained to 
                   natural data boundaries.
                 - Defect 137 - Fix defect introducec by fix of Defect 132:
		   assumed getOffset was returning T offset it's now returning
		   byte offsets.
July 9, 2004     - Added DesignByContract to the Utility headers.
July 27, 2004    - Added contrib/calibratedparams  (TUNL) for linear
                   calibrations for parameters first the fit functions.
July 30, 2004    - Added CCAENV1x90Data.h to contrib/scriptable in order
                   to support unpacking of this module.
August 9, 2004   - Modified colormgr.cc to better deal with systems that
                   have visuals that are not in decent order nor good:
                   Look through all the visuals and choose the true/direct
                   color visual with the most bits, if none exist, then
                   Choose the Pseudo color visual with the most bits.
	           If none of those exist drop back to bitonal.
