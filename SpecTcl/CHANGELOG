2.1-006 - Incorporate fix 113 - low level cutoffs lead to corrupted
          1-d displays.
        - Have build procedures clean any pre-built Gri prior to 
          tarring up the distribution.
2.1-007 - Incorporate fix 120 - memory leak on spectrum -delete -all
        - Date/time/version stamp installation.
2.1-008 
	- Incorporate fix for issue 95: parameter -list -byid fails to parse
          the output list for sorting.
        - Incorporate fix for issue 105: sbind usage level help refers to
          itself as the bind command not sbind.

          no valid spectra are included on the command line.
2.1-009 
	- Incorporate printing fixes for last channel of 1-d.
	- Incorporate printinf fix ensure that 2-d spectrum channels display
      	  all non zeroes even if they are below the threshold for the lowest
	  color range.
        - Place upper limits on 1-d graphical entries at the top  of the
	  channel rather than at the bottom.  This more realistically
	  describes what's going on

        - Backport repair for defect 145 Names with special characters
	  cause saveall to produce bad files.
2.1-013 - Backport filter generation fix from 2.2

          is spectrum slot > 999
2.1-014
	- Fixed defect 151: printing 2-d's the channels have incorrect
          values, and log prints are just plain flat lined.
2.1-015 
        - Fix un-numbered defect channel command gets/sets wrong channel
          on Gamma 2-d's.  This was broken with the introduction of

                   bind command.
April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 111 - swrite command creates a file even if no
                    existing spectra have been specified.
May 5, 2004      - Fix little diddly issues with printing and also

	           Fetching values from ValidValues that are in the
	           invalid state will now throw exceptions 
                 - Fix issue with Display/Makefile that clean leaves behind
                   detritus from flex and bison. (Added MOSTLYCLEANFILES 
                   to Display/Makefile.am).
June 8, 2004     - Increase spectrum size limits to 2^31.
June 17, 2004    - Defect 131 - There were problems generating the print tick
		   intervals when the axis specifications went in 'reverse'
		   (e.g. {100 -100 200}).  Fixed in modifications to
		   griprint.cc I think.
                 - Fix build issues in TestFiles directory so that the
                   event test generting programs can be built again Yeah.
July 1, 2004     - Defect 135 - swrite does not properly preserve the
                   axis mapping information.
	           Fallout from defect 133 discovered and fixed a defect
                   that causes the axis tick computation to DIV0 when
                   mapped axes have decreasing values going away from the
                   origin (e.g. {100 -100 201}).
July 2, 2004     - Defect 132 - Translator pointers are constrained to 
                   natural data boundaries.
                 - Defect 137 - Fix defect introducec by fix of Defect 132:

		   byte offsets.
July 9, 2004     - Added DesignByContract to the Utility headers.
July 27, 2004    - Added contrib/calibratedparams  (TUNL) for linear
                   calibrations for parameters first the fit functions.

                   to support unpacking of this module.
August 9, 2004   - Modified colormgr.cc to better deal with systems that
                   have visuals that are not in decent order nor good:
                   Look through all the visuals and choose the true/direct
                   color visual with the most bits, if none exist, then
                   Choose the Pseudo color visual with the most bits.
	           If none of those exist drop back to bitonal.
August 16, 2004 - Fix broken link  to apply.htm in categories.htm documentation
August 17, 2004  - Added the calbrated parameters sources to the mix
                   (need to get them to compile!).
                   Debugged as of August 20.
August 25, 2004  - Fixed defect 144 - memory leak if user rejects events.
September 2, 2004 - Made pseudo parameters pass validity flags too.
September 7, 2004 - Fix error in CEventFilter::setBit... which did not
                    count on there being 8 bits per byte.
September 8, 2004 - Removed in-linedness of CGate::RecursiveReest I had
                    thought this was triggering a compiler error but
                    it was not in fact.  Since this is a virt. there's no
                    gain to inlining it anyway.
September 23,2004 - NamedItem.h - decided to finally trust stl's string
                    constructors.. the way I was doing named item
 	            constructors was giving Purify fits.
September 24,2004 - Added CalibrationDistribution to produce evenly spaced
                    identical peaks.
                  - Added mechanism to fetch the applicatino's test data
                    source so that it can be modified etc.
                  - Fixed defect in CTclGrammerApp::SetupTestDatsSource
                    there was a local declaration of a m_pMultiTestSource
                    that masked the member data.:

September 30,2004 - Happy Birthday Ron!! 
                  - Fixed issue 133 Centroids and
	            FWHM not correct for mapped parameters (still).
                  - Made test distributions produce floating point params
                    to make the more flexible.. Gaussian is a symmetric
                    cutoff now.
October   4, 2004 - Added a bit of defensive programming in view of defect
                    149.
October  19, 2004 - Changed default gate names in Xamine to be better in line
	            with well behaved TCL Strings.
October 18-20  2004 - Factor all coordinate transformations into common spots 
                     part of trying to fix defect 133.
October 20,    2004 - Additional code reorganization of Xamine stuff that
                    I just could not stand to look at in fixing defect 133.
October 20,    2004 - Factor acceptgates.cc DrawPoints functions back into
                     the base class where it belongs.  Could not stand to look
	             at it duplicated in 3 different places.
October 20-22    2004 - Fix defect 145: Spaces and special characters in names
                      can make saveall loadall fail miserably...and other misc.
                      things uncovered while repairing the defect.
October 25,26    2004 - Optimize 1d long histogram increments.  Note that many
                      but not all changes will help 2d word increments too, but
                     these (less often used) histograms won't get full benefit
                     as there are modifications to the Spectrum1DL file that
		     are deliberately not propagated back to Spectrum1DW
October 27,      2004 -Optimize2d short histogram increments

November 3,2004 - Fixed position computations on expanded spectra.
November 4,2004 - Fixed defect 60 in Xamine: Spectrum choosers should come out
                 sorted by name.
November 102004 - Repaired defect 147: Xamine copy object copies to wrong
                  spectrum if slot # > 999

Edit level 2.2-001
November 30, 2004 
	- Forward port fix to defect 151 from 2.1:
             colorscales on griprint were way off for 2-d prints.
        - Fix unnumbered defect: channel get/set broke for 2-d gamma 
          spectra starting with SpecTcl 2.2
                  spectrum if slot # > 999

SpecTcl 3.0: 
      Port to gcc/g++ 3.x:
         o Lots of gruntwork with config.h etc. in all sources.
         o Added Tcl Channel inquiry functions to CTCLInterpreter to
	   allow the location of Tcl_Channel given it's name.
	    GetChannel
	    GetChannelNames
         o Added CTCLChannel object that can do simple channel operations.
            Read
	    Write
	    atEof
	    Flush
            Close
         o In {Write,Read}Command.cpp  use tcl[io]streams to connect
           swrite/sread to Tcl channel parameters rather than decoding the
	   filename.
      Propagate fix for defect 151 from 2.1 -> 2.2-> 3.0
      
December 28, 2004
    - Switch ExprLong -> strtol in contrib/scriptable CIntConfigParam.cpp
      and CIntArrayParam.cpp since ExprLong, as of Tcl 8.4 does not work
      with large unsigned values.
December 31, 2004
    - D. Bazin removed the treeparam Makefiles.  Adjust the
      contrib/Makefile.am accordingly.
January 06, 2005
    - Fixed up some missing quotes on makefile.skel's.
January 11, 2005
    - Roll in another treeparmaeter update from D. Bazin
January 12, 2005
    - swrite file creation needs an ios::trunc else existing files will 
      leave postpended data if they were larger.
January 13, 2005
    - Xamine superposition fix for id's > 999
January 26, 2005
    - Fix problem with long spectrum names:
      o Xamine's truncation was making CHistogrammer::UnbindFromDisplay
        assert fail.
      o Xamine was not putting up the correct spectrum list due to a buffer
        overflow problem in spectra.cc
January 27, 2005
    - Fix low level cutoff in 1-ds that had been fixed in 2.1 but not 
      propagated to new versions.

3.0-001
February 11, 2005
    - Added Analysis subdirectory to the build.  This directory will have stuff
      that's used by buffer analysis it is NSCL specific.
February 14, 2005
    - Completed testing of Analysis library.
February 15, 2005
    - Added C interface to Analysis library and unit tests for those.
    - Added check for paths for the 'check' c unit test framework.
February 22, 2005
    - Added/debugged classes to TCL++ that make it easy to
      do variable tracing (TCLTracedVariable, and VariableTraceCallbac e.g.).
    - Added stuff to SpecTcl that allows it to pull stuff out of string list
      buffers that represent TCL scriptlets and execute those scripts. this
      is currently useful to reconstruct control system data and other stuff
      that may be in statevariable and runvariable buffers which look like
      a bunch of set varname value commands.
    - Fix 1/0 month counting problem with run control timestamps in 
      Analysis library.
February 25, 2005
   - Documented the variable tracing support.
   - Documented run/state variable recovery.
March 4, 2005

March 8, 2005
   - Move the event sink pipeline class into Events and out of 
     the Filter directory.
   - Add SpecTcl API (tested) to the build and cvs.
March 17, 2005
