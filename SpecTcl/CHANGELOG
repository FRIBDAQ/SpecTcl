2.1-006 - Incorporate fix 113 - low level cutoffs lead to corrupted
          1-d displays.
        - Have build procedures clean any pre-built Gri prior to 
          tarring up the distribution.
2.1-007 - Incorporate fix 120 - memory leak on spectrum -delete -all
        - Date/time/version stamp installation.
2.1-008 
	- Incorporate fix for issue 95: parameter -list -byid fails to parse
          the output list for sorting.
        - Incorporate fix for issue 105: sbind usage level help refers to
          itself as the bind command not sbind.
        - Incorporate fix for issue 111: swrite creates a file even if
          no valid spectra are included on the command line.
2.1-009 
	- Incorporate printing fixes for last channel of 1-d.
	- Incorporate printinf fix ensure that 2-d spectrum channels display
      	  all non zeroes even if they are below the threshold for the lowest
	  color range.
        - Place upper limits on 1-d graphical entries at the top  of the
	  channel rather than at the bottom.  This more realistically
	  describes what's going on
        - Fix issue 118 Superpositions in window files are by id not name.
        - Fix issue 122 Speclist with a single spectrum gives blank output.
	- Fix issue 123 Print with superpositions crashes gri (gives it a
  	  bad command file).
	- Fix issue 124 FWHM not transformed to mapped coordinates.
2.1-010 - Fix Display/Makefile issues with lingering bison/flex output
          Add missing return value in ValidValue::operator=.
2.1-011 - Fix issue 135  swrite -format ascii does not retain the axis
             mapping information correctly.
        - Fallout from issue 133; fixed a defect in Display/axes.cc where
          computation of mapped channel tick mark intervals could cause
          DIV0 crashes in Xamine when the axis decreases from left to right. 
        - Backport colormanager intelligent visual choices from 2.2
2.1-012 - Backport fix for defect 144 from 2.2: Memory leak when user
          rejects events.
        - Backport repair for defect 149: Some cases where spectrum
          deletion from Xamine can kill both Xamine and SpecTcl
        - Backport repair for defect 145 Names with special characters
	  cause saveall to produce bad files.
2.1-013 - Backport filter generation fix from 2.2
          Repair defect 157: Graphical object copies fail if target
          is spectrum slot > 999
2.1-014
	- Fixed defect 151: printing 2-d's the channels have incorrect
          values, and log prints are just plain flat lined.
2.1-015 
        - Fix un-numbered defect channel command gets/sets wrong channel
          on Gamma 2-d's.  This was broken with the introduction of 
 	  arbitrary binning in 2.1.
        - In contrib/scriptable, CIntConfigParam and CIntArrayParam
          must now use strtol instead of ExprLong since the latter only deal
	  with signed values as of Tcl 8.4
2.1-016
        - In contrib/treeparam the Makefiles have now been removed by 
          D. Bazin... fixe the contrib Makefile.am to deal with this.
        - Xamine.h includes <config.h> which is not installed and also
          not required.. removed.
        - Fix the makefile skeleton so it gets the TCl flags from
          autoconf.. they were hard coded.
        - Get an even later set of updates from D. Bazin.
        - Added O_TRUNC to open on swrite command otherwise previously 
          existing files of the same name can leave junk at the end of the
          file if they were longer.
        - Fix superposition defect - if id >= 1000 wrong spectrum.
        - Fix long spectrum name defect: If names are longer than 72 chars,
          bindings get all screwed up:
          o unbind throws an assert failur because the bound name does not
            match the spectrum name due to truncation.
          o The size of the buffer into which Xamine encodes chooser names
            is too small to hold 72 chars (max title size) and the
            bracketed spectrum number.
2.1-017
    March 4, 2005
        - Set the gpVersion string to 2.1-017
    May 12, 2005
        - Fix error in the attach -format which deleted the
          old formatter and then proceded to indirectly call its OnDetach
          member.
2.1-018
    - Retry the pipe data source select if it ended due to EINTR.
    - Make this work with newer versions of autotools.
    - Make build work on linux install of lesstif.
    - Put color table stuff etc. for Xamine in $(prefix)/etc not
      $(prefix)/Etc so builds work correctly.
2.1-019
    - Fix some 64 bit uncleanlinesses in Xamine
