April 29, 2004   - Fix issue 111 - swrite command creates a file even if no
                    existing spectra have been specified.
May 5, 2004      - Fix little diddly issues with printing and also

June 8, 2004     - Increase spectrum size limits to 2^31.
June 17, 2004    - Defect 131 - There were problems generating the print tick
		   intervals when the axis specifications went in 'reverse'

                   axis mapping information.
	           Fallout from defect 133 discovered and fixed a defect
                   that causes the axis tick computation to DIV0 when
                   mapped axes have decreasing values going away from the
                   origin (e.g. {100 -100 201}).
July 2, 2004     - Defect 132 - Translator pointers are constrained to 
                   natural data boundaries.
                 - Defect 137 - Fix defect introducec by fix of Defect 132:

August 9, 2004   - Modified colormgr.cc to better deal with systems that
                   have visuals that are not in decent order nor good:
                   Look through all the visuals and choose the true/direct
                   color visual with the most bits, if none exist, then
                   Choose the Pseudo color visual with the most bits.
	           If none of those exist drop back to bitonal.
August 16, 2004 - Fix broken link  to apply.htm in categories.htm documentation
August 17, 2004  - Added the calbrated parameters sources to the mix

September 7, 2004 - Fix error in CEventFilter::setBit... which did not
                    count on there being 8 bits per byte.
September 8, 2004 - Removed in-linedness of CGate::RecursiveReest I had
                    thought this was triggering a compiler error but
                    it was not in fact.  Since this is a virt. there's no
                    gain to inlining it anyway.
September 23,2004 - NamedItem.h - decided to finally trust stl's string
                    constructors.. the way I was doing named item
 	            constructors was giving Purify fits.
September 24,2004 - Added CalibrationDistribution to produce evenly spaced
                    identical peaks.
                  - Added mechanism to fetch the applicatino's test data
                    source so that it can be modified etc.
                  - Fixed defect in CTclGrammerApp::SetupTestDatsSource
                    there was a local declaration of a m_pMultiTestSource
                    that masked the member data.:

September 30,2004 - Happy Birthday Ron!! 
                  - Fixed issue 133 Centroids and
	            FWHM not correct for mapped parameters (still).
                  - Made test distributions produce floating point params
                    to make the more flexible.. Gaussian is a symmetric
                    cutoff now.
October   4, 2004 - Added a bit of defensive programming in view of defect
                    149.
October  19, 2004 - Changed default gate names in Xamine to be better in line
	            with well behaved TCL Strings.

October 20,    2004 - Additional code reorganization of Xamine stuff that
                    I just could not stand to look at in fixing defect 133.
October 20,    2004 - Factor acceptgates.cc DrawPoints functions back into
                     the base class where it belongs.  Could not stand to look
	             at it duplicated in 3 different places.
October 20-22    2004 - Fix defect 145: Spaces and special characters in names
                      can make saveall loadall fail miserably...and other misc.
                      things uncovered while repairing the defect.
October 25,26    2004 - Optimize 1d long histogram increments.  Note that many
                      but not all changes will help 2d word increments too, but
                     these (less often used) histograms won't get full benefit
                     as there are modifications to the Spectrum1DL file that
		     are deliberately not propagated back to Spectrum1DW
October 27,      2004 -Optimize2d short histogram increments

November 3,2004 - Fixed position computations on expanded spectra.
November 4,2004 - Fixed defect 60 in Xamine: Spectrum choosers should come out
                 sorted by name.

          spectra starting with SpecTcl 2.2
                  spectrum if slot # > 999

SpecTcl 3.0: 
      Port to gcc/g++ 3.x:
         o Lots of gruntwork with config.h etc. in all sources.
         o Added Tcl Channel inquiry functions to CTCLInterpreter to
	   allow the location of Tcl_Channel given it's name.
	    GetChannel
	    GetChannelNames
         o Added CTCLChannel object that can do simple channel operations.
            Read
	    Write
	    atEof
	    Flush
            Close
         o In {Write,Read}Command.cpp  use tcl[io]streams to connect
           swrite/sread to Tcl channel parameters rather than decoding the
	   filename.
      Propagate fix for defect 151 from 2.1 -> 2.2-> 3.0
      
December 28, 2004
    - Switch ExprLong -> strtol in contrib/scriptable CIntConfigParam.cpp

      with large unsigned values.
December 31, 2004
    - D. Bazin removed the treeparam Makefiles.  Adjust the

January 13, 2005
    - Xamine superposition fix for id's > 999
January 26, 2005
    - Fix problem with long spectrum names:
      o Xamine's truncation was making CHistogrammer::UnbindFromDisplay
        assert fail.
      o Xamine was not putting up the correct spectrum list due to a buffer
        overflow problem in spectra.cc
January 27, 2005

      do variable tracing (TCLTracedVariable, and VariableTraceCallbac e.g.).
    - Added stuff to SpecTcl that allows it to pull stuff out of string list
      buffers that represent TCL scriptlets and execute those scripts. this
      is currently useful to reconstruct control system data and other stuff
      that may be in statevariable and runvariable buffers which look like
      a bunch of set varname value commands.
    - Fix 1/0 month counting problem with run control timestamps in

   - Remove nulls from Xamine's log files and replace them with \n's instead.
April 29, 2005

    the results of the spectrum -list command
May 27, 2005
  - Added support for a glob like pattern in the switch of the clear, pararmeter

3.0-002
  - Fix defect with guintegrate - was multiply deleting contours during
    integration.
  - Did  a bunch of refactoring to make the integration loop code look nicer.
  - Treeparameter fixes: GUI should save empty units on unit-less variables and
    spectra.  In addition for old files, treevariable -set should have units optional
3.0-003
  - Remove requirement for fortran at config time.

3.0-004
  - Do a bit of recasting in order to make cleaner compiles on ia64 systems.
3.0-005
  - Fix errors in gamma spectrum increment.  When there are no valid parameters
    in an event, the outer loop of the 2d gamma spectrum increment will
    loop almost infinitely and eventually segfault.
3.0-006
   - Retry pipe data source select if it fails with eintr.
   - Fix defect 188 - Grobj files write out spectrum ids rather than 
     names.. The fix will read old files, but new files will use

   - Check for gd in configure and create appropriate compiler/ld
     options.
SpecTcl-3.0-009
   - Defect 197 : scaling.h the averaging boxes for 2d average reduction
                  were too wide by a channel
   - Defect 200 : long/int mixup that is 64 bit unclean in gamma1DL.cpp
                  This makes 64bit gamma1dL spectra have only everyother
                  channel set and can overwrite past the end of the spectrum
                  as well fi the parameter range covers more than the
                  spectrum range!!
   - Defect 209 : more issues like Defect 200.
   - Defect 210 : SpecTcl/AppInit.cpp had sscanf of int -> long. 64 bit bad.
   - Defect 211 : Creating g1 spectrum with empty parameter list crashes with
                  SEGFLT.

       to Xamine free list corruption
   - Fix error in wysiwyg printing when zoomed.
   - Fix an off by one error in scaling 1-d lineary channels.  For small scales
     and channel values the hieght of the channel was visibly lower than the 
     corresponding tick mark.
   - Enh 194    : provide more precision in output of integration.

        Nov 17, 2006 No longer distribute setup.tcl with Skel.
        Dec 19, 2006 Fix CXdrInputStream.cpp per D. Caussyn's catch,
                    delete [] m_pBuffer not delete m_pBuffer
