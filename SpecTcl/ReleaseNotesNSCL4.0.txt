Information about SpecTcl-0.3 -> 0.4 upgrade, and future upgrades.
1. From now on, the current version of SpecTcl's sources can be retreived from:
   /opt/spectcl/current/Skel on Linux.
  /usr/local/spectcl/current/Skel on Tru64.

2. To allow modified 0.3 sources to compile successfully you will need to
   edit one line of your Makefile:
    The first line of the makefile reads:
      INSTDIR=/opt/spectcl
    Change this to:
      INSTDIR=/opt/0.3/spectcl

3. Brief rundown of modifications needed to get 0.3 sources to work as 
   0.4 sources.

3.1 Obtaining the new skeletons:
    Make a new directory for your 0.4 build and
      cp /opt/spectcl/current/Skel/* into it.
    User specific code and hook are all in MySpecTclApp.cpp.
3.2 Modifing the new build stuff to user your old sources;
    a. Edit MySpecTclApp.cpp and copy into it all of the stuff
       in your old UserCode.cpp
    b. Modify the definition of your unpacker so that it derives from
       CEventProcessor instead of from a CUnpacker
       e.g.:
          class CTestUnpacker : public CUnpacker
       becomes:
          class CTestUnpacker : public CEventProcessor

     c. Modify the return value of the operator() function to be kfTRUE
        rather than the event size.
     d. Prior to return, call rAna.SetEventSize(nbytes) where nbytes is
        the number of bytes in the event you have just decoded.

4.0 Specialized modifications:
    If you have done some "interesting" modifications like TCL variable
    binding or creating TCL commands, Locate the appropriate member function 
    of CMySpecTclApp to modify.
