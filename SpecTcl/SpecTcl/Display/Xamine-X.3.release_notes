Subject: Xamine X.3 released.
Content-Length: 7083

  I have installed Xamine X.3 on the following systems:

NSCL cluster.
Rudolf.nscl.msu.edu
Thoenn.nscl.msu.edu
foxsun.nscl.msu.edu
fourpi.nscl.msu.edu

  I have also placed an unsupported distribution set of this software in 
our anonymous ftp site (rudolf.nscl.msu.edu [35.8.32.110] in 
/pub/daq/Xamine.tar.Z)

Release notes for Xamine X.3  - Pre-release version 0.3

1. Several problems with window I/O have been fixed and I believe that this
   subsystem is now bulletproof.

2. Axis ticks values are now restricted to be i*10^y where i is in {1,2,5}.

3. Marker graphical objects have been implemented.  A marker is a spectrum
   position mark in X an Y.  It shows as a filled diamond on the display of
   the spectrum.  To create a Marker, you should either click on the Marker
   button on the button bar or select the menu entry Graph_objects->Add->Marker
   A dialog will pop up prompting you for one or more markers.  Points can
   either be typed in or clicked in with the mouse.  The same mechanics as
   for Expand hold vis a vis adding and deleting points.  When you have the
   marker positions appropriately, click Ok or Accept.

4. Summing regions have been implemented.  These are either low/high cuts (1d)
   or arbitrary closed contours (2d).  They can be accepted either by clicking
   on the Summing Region button or the Graph_objects->Add->Summing Region
   menu entry.  The mechanics of accepting points is the same as for markers
   except that two points are required for a 1-d summing region and at least
   3 points are required for a 2-d summing region.  When the summing region
   appears as you'd like it to, click Ok or Accept on the pop up dialog.

5. The Integrate Button and Graph_objects->Integrate menu selection now works.
   It will bring up a scrolling text window which will give the results of
   integrations performed on all summing regions defined in a spectrum.  If
   you Integrate without dismissing the text window, then the text is appended
   to prior integrations. Dismiss will clear the text however.  If logging is
   enabled (via File->Logging menu entry), then integrations will go to the
   current log file.

6. Info has been expanded to list the currently accepted graphical objects
   as well as all the information it used to list.

7. The user can save and restore graphical objects that have been accepted
   (markers and summing regions).  Graphical objects are saved in a textual
   file which ought to be pretty easy to understand/modify/extract histogrammer
   contours from and so on. 
   a) To save the current grahpical object set, click on either of the menu
     entries:
      File->Save->Graphical Objects or Graphical_objects->Write Objects
     A file list dialog will prompt you for a graphical objects file.  The
     filters are set so that *.grobj are interpreted as graphcal object
     files however if you type in the name of a new file you will need to
     explicitly provide the .grobj extension.
   b) To read a graphical objects file, you may click on either 
      File->Restore->Graphical Objects or Graphical_objects->Read Objects
      menu items.  A file list dialog will prompt you for the name of the
      graphical objects file.  The filters are set up by default to look for
      *.grobj in the current directory.  If you explicitly type a name
      (as opposed to clicking one), you must supply the .grobj part of the 
      name however.

8. Graphical objects can be destroyed.  To do so, click on the menu entry
   Graphical_Objects->Delete. A selection dialog will pop up allowing you to
   delete any of the graphical objects.  You can delete a graphical object
   by double clicking it or typing any of the following:
   Object id -- The numerical part of the thing in brackets in the list.
   Object name-- The name you gave the graphical object when you accepted it.
                 Blanks are all significant, but case is not.

9. The title format has been changed slightly to attempt to 
   a) Make it look a bit more like what it looks like on the spectrum chooser
      list and
   b) Take up less real-estate on the average which in turn means that you will
      see it more often and it will be in larger typeface when it is visible.

10. Update logic for graphical objects and expansion lines being accepted has
    been fixed up a bit so that points accepted in the middle of an update of
    the spectrum will be displayed correctly.

11. Scroll bars have been added to the button box to allow access to all
    functions when the display window is made small (NSCL internal users have
    had this since X.1.5 I think.

12. Multiple axis tick marks with the same value have been fixed.

13. The Spectrum properties dialog has been fixed to provide remove edge
    synchronization failures in Xt.  This should also result in slightly faster
    initial popups.

14. Auto-scale for 1-d will set the highest channel at 80% of full scale to
    allow the peak to be seen beneath the 'ceiling'.

15. Color renditions of 2-d spectra are now done into a complete image rather
    than a scan line at a time.  This improves performance somewhat however
    more work is needed to improve 2-d performance.

16. Client function (f77)Xamine_GetMemoryName added to allow client to publish
    the name of the shared memory region that is being used for the spectra.
    Note that a routine to map to this memory by name will be but has not yet
    been written.  The name of the routine will be 

	(f77)Xamine_MapMemoryByName(name, size)

    Therefore, people intending to use this feature should build around this
    calling sequence.

  At the beginning of January I will be publishing a feature list for 
Xamine X.4 (pre-release 4).  The following items will definitely be on that
list.  If you have particular desires besides what I have listed below, then
please drop me some E-mail (fox@foxsun.nscl.msu.edu).

Preliminary X.4 feature list:

Cut gates (lower/upper limit 1-d gate).
Band gate (2-d gate which is an unclosed polyline).
Contour gate (2-d gate which is a closed polygon).
Improve 2-d update performance.
Remove requirement for refresh of spectrum when graphical objects are
  finally accepted or deleted.
