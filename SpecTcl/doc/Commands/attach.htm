<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>attach {switches...} connection
  Where:
     Switches are taken from the following:
     -format filter|nscl  - Choose buffer format
     -size nBytes - Number of bytes per buffer.
     {sourcetype} which can be only one of:
        -file  when connection is the name of the file
               from which data will be taken
        -tape  When connection is the name of a tape device
               special file and the tape command selects
               files on the ansi labelled volume
        -pipe  When connection is a command whose stdout is 
               taken as the event source.
</pre>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>Detaches SpecTcl from the current source of events and
attaches it to a new source.</p>

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>

<p>This command detaches SpecTcl from the current source of
events and attaches it to a new event source: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Data analysis must be halted.</li>
    <li>If successful, returns the data source e.g.
        file:filename, or online:url, or tape:devicename</li>
</ul>

<p>The -format switch selects the buffer decoder.&nbsp; Presently, nscl and
filter buffer decoders are built into SpecTcl. Tailored SpecTcls also exist to
decode Xsys and HIMAC data.&nbsp; In the future we plan to integrate these into
an extensible buffer format list as is done for the sread/swrite commands.</p>

<p>The -size switch selects the size of each read done on the data file in
bytes.</p>

<h3>attach -file <em>filename</em> [<em>blocksize</em>]</h3>

<p>Attaches SpecTcl to a file data source. <em>filename</em> is
the path to the file. This can be either a relative or absolute
path.&nbsp; <em>blocksize</em> if supplied is the buffersize of
data in that file.&nbsp; If omitted, this defaults to 8192 for
the 'standard' NSCL event tape blocksize.&nbsp; The file is
opened and can be immediately analyzed using the <a
href="start.htm"><strong>start</strong></a> command. Analysis of
a data source can be halted using the <a href="stop.htm"><strong>stop</strong></a>
command.</p>

<h3>attach -tape <em>devicename</em></h3>

<p>Attaches SpecTcl to a tape data source.&nbsp; The <em>devicename</em>
parameter is the name of the tape device on which the tape is
physically mounted (e.g. /dev/nrmt0h on Digital UNIX). Tape data
sources can contain several event files.&nbsp; Each file is
delimited by ANSI tape labels which provide, among other things,
a filename and the file blocksize.&nbsp; The <a href="tape.htm"><strong>tape</strong></a>
command is used to actually select a single file from the tape.
&nbsp; This must be done before starting analysis. </p>

<h3>attach -pipe [-size <em>nBytes</em>] command string</h3>

<p>Attaches SpecTcl to a pipeline data source. A pipeline data
source allows SpecTcl to connect to data sources which do not map
well to files, for example, online data acquisition systems or
ftp or httpd served data. the <strong>-size</strong> switch
indicates what buffersize to use for the reads. If omitted the
NSCL default buffer size is used. the remainder of the command
line is treated as a UNIX command string. The attach command
then:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Creates a UNIX pipe, and attaches itself to the read side
        of the pipe, using it as a data source.</li>
    <li>Creates a child process, whose stdout is attached to the
        write side of the pipe.</li>
    <li>In the child process executes the command string.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examples:</h4>

<p>The attach -pipe command below is equivalent to using a file
data source:</p>

<pre>attach -pipe cat run1.evt</pre>

<p>The command <em>cat run1.evt</em> copies the file run1.evt to
it's stdout which is the write side of the pipe on which SpecTcl
is reading. Note that unlike a -file source, this sort of pipe
source allows you to easily sum the results from several runs:</p>

<pre>attach -pipe cat run1.evt run2.evt run3.evt</pre>

<p>The command above analyzes three event files as if they were a
single event source file. The following command shows how to
analyze data which has been compressed using the unix compress
command:</p>

<pre>attach -pipe zcat run1.evt</pre>

<p>The file run1.evt.Z (or run1.evt.gz on Linux) is decompressed
and analyzed.</p>

<p>Note that pipelines and redirections are not supported on the
command line, however shell scripts are allowed. The command and
script below support analyzing a single file of data which is
contained in a gzipped tar file:</p>

<p>attach -pipe tarread run1.evt</p>

<p>Along with the shell script tarread:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/csh
#   Shell script to extract  a single run from a gzipped 
#   tar file and send it to stdout
#
gunzip -c | tar xf - $1
cat $1
rm  $1</pre>
