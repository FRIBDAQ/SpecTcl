<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Manipulates gates as folds on gamma spectra.</p>
<ul>
  <li>-apply Applies a gate as a fold on a gamma spectrum.  The gate must be a 
      gamma gate.  The Spectra must all be gamma spectra.  The fold causes the
      spectrum to be incremented for the set of parameters that don't make the
      gate when the gate as aa whole is made.  Folds are applied in addition
      to gates.</li>
  <li>-list lists the spectra that have folds and their folds.  If the <em>pattern</em>
  is supplied it is interpreted as a glob pattern.  Only spectra that match
  the glob pattern are shown.</li>
  <li>-remove removes the fold from the spectrum.
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<P>Folds are a simple mechanism to unravel complex gamma spectra into coincident
sets of peaks.  Whenver a fold is applied to a gamma spectrum, if the gate on that
spectrum allows the gamma spetrum to be incremented, the fold controls the way in
which the gamma specrum is incremented.
<P>
Without a fold, a gamma 1d spectrum is incremented once for each parameter in the
spectrum.  A gamma 2d spectrum is incremented once for each parameter pair in the
spectrum.   This provides a means to aggregate all of the gamma ray detectors in 
an experiment into a single spectrum.
<P>
With a fold, each parameter (for a gamma slice) or parameter pair (for a gamma
band or contour) is checked against the gate.  Whenever a parameter or pair of 
parameters satisfies the gate, the spectrum is incremented for all other 
parameters (1D) or parameter pairs (2D) that make up the spectrum.
The effect is to remove the peak around which the gate was drawn and leave only 
the peaks that occur in coincidence with that peak (note that a bump in a 2-d
spectrum already represents a gamma-gamma coincidence allowing 4-fold coincidence
spectra to be produced by looking for bumps in a 2-d spectrum on which a 
gamma contour e.g. has been applied).
<P>
<PRE>
fold -apply gate spectrum ?spectrum ...?
</PRE>
<P>
The -apply switch causes the single gamma gate to be applied as a fold to 
the set of spectra listed on the command line.
<P>
<pre>
fold -list ?pattern?
</pre>
<P>
The -list switch lists the set of spectra with folds that match the optional pattern.
If the pattern is not supplied, it is taken to be &#042; which matchs all spectra.
The result of the fold -list command is a list of spectra with folds.  Each list
element is, itself a two element list consisting of, in order, the spectrum name
and the name of the gate that is used to produce the folded spectrum.
<P>
<PRE>
fold -remove spectrum
</PRE>
<P>
Removes a gate fold application from a spectrum.  Any gate that is applied
as a normal gate remains.
