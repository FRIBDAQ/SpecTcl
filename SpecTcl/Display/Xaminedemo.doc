  I have released another pre-pre-release of Xamine to the 'public'.
This version contains the first level of functionality that is likely
to be available in the first pre-release (the version that people can use
to display real spectra with sara/smaug etc.).  I would like people to play
around with the pre-pre-release in order to get feedback about how I've
handled various aspects of the program.  This memo includes:

1. Instructions on how to start Xamine alpha
2. A description of the implemented functions.

1. Starting Xamine:

VMS:
====
    $SETUP XAMINE
    $XAMINE

To use a custom colortable, use COLORSET to make a family of colortables
called Xamine[n].ctbl   where [n] is the number of planes represented by
the colortable (2-6).  Most NSCL display servers  will use the 6 plane color
table (64 color levels for 2-d color plots).  Either place these color
tables in your login directory or create a logical name XAMINE_COLORTABLE_DIR
which points to the color table directory. The default color maps are in 
DAQ_LIB:
 Run colorset after setting up Xamine using the command:

colorset planes

planes = number of planes (2 through 6) of color in the color map you're making.

UNIX:
=====
   /daq/bin/Xamine

Custom colortables work the same in UNIX, however:

  colortables are made using /daq/bin/colorset

  default color tables are in /daq/etc

2. Functionality of pre-pre-release Xamine:
  Xamine comes stocked with some test spectra.  The first 3 are 1-d, the last
  2 are 2-d's.  At present, Xamine does not yet link to the outside world.
  Note that the current version of Xamine will work equally well on color,
  Monochrome and Grey scale display systems.  Color drawing performance is
  tuned to 8-plane color systems.  That is not cast in concrete however.

  The following buttons at the bottom of the Xamine window work:

Geometry -- Sets the number of rows and columns of display panes.
            (AEDTSK 'w' command).  Once the geometry is set there is always
            a 'selected' pane.  The selected pane is usually well highlighted
            if you have reasonable color settings for motif.  Use the mouse to
            click in a pane to select it.
Display  -- Place a spectrum into the selected pane. (AEDTSK 'd' command).
Display+ -- Place a spectrum into the selected pane and then move the selection
            by the advance value (default value is to the next pane).
Zoom     -- Toggle which makes the currently selected pane fill the display
            part of the window.  Note that Zoom is only allowed when the 
            selected pane contains a spectrum. (AEDTSK 'f' command).
Update All-- Update/redraw all displayed spectra (must be at least one pane
            containing a spectrum. (AEDTSK 'f' 'w' command sequence).
Update Selected - Redraws the selected AEDTSK pane (AEDTSK 'u' command).
+         -- Scale up spectrum in selected pane (one must be displayed or this
             is disabled).  + for autoscaled spectra is currently a no-op.
             Eventually will cause ghosting of + button (AEDTSK '+' command).
-         -- Scale down spectrum in selected pane (See + for restrictions).
             (AEDTSK - command).

The following menu entries are implemented:

File:
  Save->Save Windows... Saves the current window configuration to file.
  Restore->Restore Windows... Reads the current window configuration from file.
  Exit   Exit from Xamine.  If some change has been made which would result in
         a different window configuration than the last one read in, then you
         get an are you sure kind of warning prompt.

Window:
  Geometry  - Same as Geometry button.
  Read Configuration...  Same as Restore->Restore Windows...
  Write Configuration... Same as Save->Save Windows...
  Reset     - Reset size of Xamine window to 'default' size.  Xamine window
              can be resized arbitrarily by the user and the extra size will
              be used to show more detailed images of the spectra.
Spectra:
  Display Spectrum...  Same as Display button.
  Display Spectrum+... Same as Display + button.
  Set Advance...       Allows you to set the number of panes by which Display +
                       will advance the selection.
  Update All           Same as Update All button.
  Update Selected      Same as Update Selected button.
  Properties...        Allows you to change the properties of spectrum in the
                       selected pane.  Forces an update on the spectrum when
		       properties are changed (A bit more powerful but same
                       idea as AEDTSK 'm' command).
  Zoom                 Same as zoom button.

Options:
   This menu implements functionality not present in the AEDTSK.  At present,
if you want to fill an AEDTSK pane set with a bunch of spectra all with 
something other than the default mode (e.g. log Y axis), you must do individual
'm' commands for each spectrum after it has been 'd'isplayed.  Xamine has
the concept of a 'default' mode.  The options in this menu that are implemented
control the default mode.. that is the set of Properties a spectrum will have
when it is placed in a pane.

   Axis Labels...     Determine how much axis labelling you want displayed.
   Spectrum Titles... Turn on or off various elements of the spectrum title.
   Spectrum Attributes.. Set miscellaneous spectrum attributes having to do with
                      counts axes including:
                       X/Y axis orientation.
                       Log/Lin counts axis.
                       Auto/Manual scale and full scale value.
                       Low level cutoff enable and value
                       High level cutoff enable and value.
   Spectrum Reduction.. Governs how Xamine handles what happens when there are
                       fewer pixels than necessary to display a spectrum in
                       full resolution.
   Rendition           Set the default 1-d and 2-d renditions.
   Print Setup         Sets up the destination and type of printer.
                       NOTE: Printing is not yet supported so this is just
                             to give a feel for the user interface.
   Logfile Setup       Sets up the destination of the logfile
                       NOTE: Logging is not yet implemented so this is just
                             to give a feel for the user interface.
Help:
  About... -- Shows version number and credits.
  Help...  -- Gives some text describing the basic flavor of Xamine.
              NOTE: All prompting dialogs have fully implemented Help buttons,
                    so if you're not sure what to do when something pops up
                    in your face, then click the help button on the thingy that
                    popped.
Disclaimers:
1.  Xamine is not claimed to be a fully implemented or even a useful program
    at this stage.  Think of it as a prototype to test if our ideas about
    user interface and display are on the right track.  Therefore if there's
    something you don't like about it, please send me feedback.

2. This memo is not claimed to be full Xamine documentation.  That has not
   been written yet either.

3. Xamine is not claimed to be error free at this time either.  Please report
   all crashes, failures and suprises to me along with as much information as
   you have about the events leading up to the failure, and as much information
   as you have about the failure (e.g. error messages from the terminal that
   you ran Xamine from.  With your help in this regard, we can exterminate 
   these errors *before* they become part of a released, 'useful' program.

	Thanks,
	Ron
