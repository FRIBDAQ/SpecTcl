<p align="center">Installation instructions for immediate updates</p>
<p align="center">D. Bazin </p>
<p align="justify">The default version of the TreeParameter package is installed in the directory $SpecTclHome/contrib/treeparam. Programs using this default version should follow the directions found in the TreeParameter documentation at <a href="http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq/appnotes/TreeParameter.html">http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq/appnotes/TreeParameter.html</a></p>
<p align="justify">Because I have no means of updating the default TreeParameter package other than waiting for the next SpecTcl update, immediate updates can only be installed locally by users on their own directory tree. The latest updates allows this to be done by using a Tcl variable named TreeParameterHome. If this variable is not initialized in the SpecTclRC.tcl startup script, it is then automatically set to the default value $SpecTclHome/contrib/treeparam. Users can therefore install the latest update somewhere in their directory tree and initialize TreeParameterHome to point to that folder. Additionally, the path of the #include directives in the C++ code should be changed to that same folder. The latest release of the TreeParameter package can be found <a href="treeparam.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">11/08/04: TreeParameter package version 1.2.1</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Reset() function clears the value of the parameter to 0 and makes it invalid for SpecTcl histograms </li>
  <li>TreeParameters now propagate the validity of their contents: if the right hand side of an expression contains at a TreeParameter which is invalid, then the TreeParameter on the left hand side is set invalid. This feature eliminates the need to test the validity of TreeParameters before they are used in an expression, but also requires more carefulness in some cases, such as when summing TreeParameters together: if only one of them is invalid, the result will also be invalid </li>
  <li>Added the method CTreeParameter operator=(CTreeParameter&amp; aCTreeParameter) to allow multiple assignment in expressions such as par1 = par2 = something</li>
</ul>
