/*!
   This class provides an exception that can be thrown if
   a program detects a 'state mismatch'. A state mismatch
   is said to occur when something is requested of an object,
   but its internal state forbids that service from being rendered to
   the client.  In particular, this was developed to deal with
   services being requested in the TCL class library of objects
   that require an interpreter to satisfy, when objects were not
   (yet) bound to an interpreter.
