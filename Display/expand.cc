/*
** Facility:
**   Xamine -- NSCL display program.
** Abstract:
**   expand.cc:
**     This file contains software which manages the Expand/UnExpand
**     part of the user interface.  The UnExpand function is pretty
**     trivial, it just removes any applied expansion from the currently
**     displayed spectrum.  The Expand Function is a bit more involved.
**     A dialog is displayed which allows the user to enter two points.
**     As the points are entered, they are displayed on the spectrum as
**     an expansion region (1d) or box (2d).  Points can be accepted either
**     by typing them in or by clicking them in with the mouse.  The points
**     can also be edited (e.g. removed) prior to acceptance.

**      selection set.  The first thing we do is kill off the
**      current set of points (done by redrawing them since they draw in
**      XOR mode).   Then we add the point and redraw the points.  Since
**      the points are drawn in XOR mode we need to do the initial undraw
**      for two reasons:
**        1. Pt1 could already be defined in which case we need to get rid
**           of the old point.
**        2. Pt2 could already be drawn in which case we want to make sure
**           it stays visible.
**      NOTE:  There is a difference of behavior for 2-d and 1-d displays.
**             a 2-d display requires both the X and Y coordinates of the
**             point to be gotten while the 1-d only requires the X coordinate
**       This function assumes that the points are comming from the text fld.
**       of the dialog widget.
** Formal Parameters:
**   XMWidget *wid:
**     Pointer to the dialog widget.
**   XtPointer user_d:
**     User data, in this case a pointer to the input state.
**   XtPointer call_d:
**     Ignored callback data.
