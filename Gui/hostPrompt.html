        <h1>Attach Online Host Prompt</h1>
        <p>
            This dialog allows you to supply the host from which you want SpecTcl
            to receive online data.  This function depends on an installation of the
            NSCL DAQ system in /usr/opt/daq.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter the name of the computer from which you want to receive data and click
            <b>Ok</b>.  If you have decided you don't want to change SpecTcl's data source, just
            click <b>Cancel</b>
