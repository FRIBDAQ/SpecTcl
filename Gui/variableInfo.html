            Tree variables are a subset of Tcl variables organized in a structural hierarchy.
            A tree variable has a value and and optional unit of measure associted with it. Tree
            variables are created by being declared in the user's analysis code.
            Tree variables do not have any additional substructure.  They display their current value
            and units on a single line of the browser window
