        <h1>Set the Filter Parameters</h1>
        <p>
            Each Filter has an associated list of parameters.  When the filter writes
            an event to the output file, it only writes its parameters.  Thus filters
            select both a subset of the events, and a subset of the parameters within
            this subset of events.
        </p>
        <p>
            This stage of the wizard allows you to choose the parameters that will be written for
            each event that satisfies the filter's gate.  The left side of the wizard has a limited
            object browser that allows you to browse the parameters.  The right side of the wizard
            contains a list of the parameters you want this filter to write.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a parameter to the listbox, double click it in the browser.  If you accidently add
            the wrong parameter, double click it in the listbox to remove it.

            The buttons at the bottom of the filter wizard have the following meanings:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Cancel the creation of the filter and dismiss the wizard.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Display this help text.</li>
                <li><b>Back</b>   Go back to the previous step of the filter wizard
                                  (choosing a filter gate).</li>
                <li><b>Next</b>   Continue defining the filter.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
