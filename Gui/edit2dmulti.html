  <h3><a name="About">About 2d summing spectra</a></h3>
  <p>
     2-d summing spectra provide a multiply incremented 2-d spectrum.
     A 2-d summing spectrum is defined on a set of parameters.  The parameter
     list (n parameters) is interpreted as n/2 ordered pairs.  
     If the spectrum gate is satsified for an event, the spectrum is incremented
     once for each of these ordered pairs that is completely present in the event.
     </p>
  <p>
    From the definition of the spectrum, clearly an even number of parameters must
    be provided (the same number of x as y parameters).  The intent of a 2-d
    summing spectrum is to produce a spectrum that is the superposition of a
    set of gainmatched parameters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Xamine can accept gates on 2-d summing spectra.  The results, however are
    as follows:
    <ul>
       <li>An band or contour is created for each pair of ordered parameters
          that is true when those parameters satisfy the gate condition drawn
	  on the spectrum</li>
       <li>An Or gate is created that is true whenever <em>any</em> of the
          gates created in the step above are true.
	  </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
     A 2d summing spectrum can be gated just as any other spectrum can.

  <h3><a name="Operating">Operating the 2d sum spectrum editor</a></h3>
  <p>
     While 2-d summing spectra are normally created on parameters, the
     spectrum editor recognizes that often there are already 2-d spectra
     created on the parameter pairs you want to use.  Therefore the browser
     part of the editor shows both individual parameters and all 2-d spectra.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double clicking a 2-d spectrum will add its x and y parameters to the list
     of X/Y parameters in the spectrum definition.</li>
    <li>Double clicking a parameter in the browser will add it to the 
      parameter list who's radio button is on.  It will also advance the radio
      button to the next parameter list, so that without doing anything other than
      double-clicking parameters you can alternately define x and y parameters
      for the spectrum.</li>
    <li>Double clicking a parameter in one of the axis list boxes removes it
       <em>and its counterpart if defined</em> from the parameters in the 
       spectrum definition.  Counterpart is defined as the parameter on the
       corresponding line of the other list box.</li>
    <li>You may type in axis definitions in the axis definition fields below the
        listboxes.  If a parameter is added to one of the list boxes, and if
        the corresponding axis fields are not yet filled in, if the parameter has
        suggested axis definitions associated with it it they will be entered
	for you in the list box
	</li>
   </ul>
