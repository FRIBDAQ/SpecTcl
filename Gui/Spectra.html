        <h1>Spectrum Objects in the <a href="Browser.html">Browser</a></h1>
        <p>
            If you come across terminology that is unfamiliar, there is
            a <a href="Vocabulary.html">Glossary</a> help page.</p>
        <p>
            Spectrum objects are stored under the Spectra top level folder in the
            object browser.  A single click on the + to the left of a spectrum provides
            access to the <a href="spectrumInfo.html">spectrum description</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>The top level folder context menu</h2>
        <p>
            The top level Spectra menu has a context menu that can be accessed by right clicking the folder.
            This menu has the following functions:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>New... </b>pops up a spectrum editor dialog allowing a new spectrum to be created.</li>
                <li><b>Refresh Tree</b>Refreshes the tree.  Normally the tree will refresh itself as needed
                    whenever changes are made.  However if changes are made the GUI is not aware of,
                    you may need to manually refresh the tree.</li>
                <li><b>Clear All</b> Clears the counts from all of the Spectra known to SpecTcl.  This
                    is equivalent to the <tt>clear -all</tt> SpecTcl command.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Double clicking a spectrum</h2>
        <p>Each Spectrum object can be double clicked to edit its properties.  Note that changing the properties
            of a spectrum really means deleting and re-creating the spectrum.  Which causes the contents of the
            spectrum to be cleared.  The spectrum editor also allows you to use the spectrum you double clicked
            as a template for a new spectrum.  Double click the spectrum and just enter a new name for the
            spectrum in the spectrum editor dialog.  One application for this would be to create a new spectrum
            that is just a gated version of the original spectrum.
        </p>
        <h2>Spectrum object context menus</h2>
        <p>
           Spectrum objects also have context menus.  As with the  top level folder, the spectrum
           context menu is accessed by right clicking a spectrum object.  The spectrum context menu provides
           the following functions:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Edit...</b> Edits the definition of that spectrum.   Note that changing the properties
            of a spectrum really means deleting and re-creating the spectrum.  Which causes the contents of the
            spectrum to be cleared.  The spectrum editor also allows you to use the spectrum you double clicked
            as a template for a new spectrum.  Double click the spectrum and just enter a new name for the
            spectrum in the spectrum editor dialog.  One application for this would be to create a new spectrum
            that is just a gated version of the original spectrum.</li>
                <li><b>Clear</b>  Clears the counts from that spectrum. </li>
                <li><b>Gate...</b> Apply a gate to the spectrum.  Applying a gate to a spectrum does not
                    automatically clear the spectrum counts.</li>
                <li><b>Write...</b>Write the contents of the spectrum to file</li>
                <li><b>Delete...</b>If a prompt to confirm the deletion is accepted, the spectrum
                    is deleted</li>
            </ul>
