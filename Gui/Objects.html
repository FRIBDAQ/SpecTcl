        <h1>SpecTcl objects and the browser</h1><a name="top" />
        <p>
            The SpecTcl browser manipulates the four major SpecTcl object types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spectra (or histograms if you prefer)</li>
            <li>Parameters both tree and non tree parameters. </li>
            <li>Gates</li>
            <li>TreeVariables</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these object types is managed by the browser as a folder containing
            a hierarchy of objects.  The hierarchy is constructed by using the period "."
            to represent separators of hierarchy levels.  Thus, for example, the tree
            parameter named event.raw.de is represented as:
        </p>
        <pre>
                event +
                      +-->raw +
                              +-->de
        </pre>
        <p>
            Each object can be opened up to show increasing levels of detail about its definition.
            In addition right clicking top level folders and objects brings up a menu of actions that
            can be performed on the object, or objects of that type (in the case of the top level folders).
            Double clicking an object will also bring up an editor for the object.
