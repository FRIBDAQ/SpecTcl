        <h2>Sections of the browser window</h2>
        <p>
            The Browser window has three sections.
            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="Menus.html">menubar</a>
                    containing a set of pulldown menus from which major browser commands can be
                    selected.</li>
                <li>The object browser, which allows you to view and manipulate the SpecTcl Objects.</li>
                <li>A <a href="statusLine.html">status line</a> which displays information about the
                    analysis currently underway.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            This page will describe the functionality available in the middle or object browser section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The object browser consists of toplevel folders for each of the major object types supported by
            SpecTcl.  These object types are Spectra, Parameters, Gates and Variables.  Each of these
            Top level folders can be opened by clicking on the + to the left of the folder.   Each toplevel folder
            also has a context menu that you can access by right clicking on the folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you open a top level folder you will see objects and subfolders.  Subfolders do not have context
            menus associated with them.  Objects, however do have associated context menus that once more
            are accessed via a right click on the object.  Subfolders can be opened by clicking on the + to the left
            of the folder.  With the exception of variables, objects also have descriptions.  Object description
            details can be accessed by clicking on the + to the left of the object name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each object also has a selection action associated with it.  This action usually is to edit the
            definition or value of the object.  The selection action is activated by double clicking the
            object.
        </p>
