        <h1>Creating a Contour From Two Bands</h1>
        <p>
            This dialog allows you to select a pair of bands that have been defined on the
            same pair of parameters and create a contour that is formed by joining the endpoints
            of the bands.   This is useful for charged particle analysis where it is easy to draw
            bands between particle groups, and you'd like to turn these bands into gates around each
            particle group.
        </p>
        <p>
            The editor has a limited browser on the left side and a status area on the right side.
            The limited browser initially only displays the parameters, but contains a folder for gates
            as well.  When you choose a pair of parameters, the Gates folder is populated with the
            set of bands that are defined on those parameters.
        <p>
            One of the parameters in the status area is always highlighted.  The highlighted parameter
            can be selected by clicking on it.  Double clicking a parameter in the browser:
            <ul>
                <li>Loads the parameter into the highlighted parameter in the status area</li>
                <li>Updates the set of gates that populate the Gates folder.</li>
                <li>If the currently selected bands are not defined on the resulting parameter pair,
                    the gates are removed from the status area</li>
                <li>The other parameter in the status area is highlighted.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a pair of parameters has been selected, you can select the gates. This is done
            in a manner analagous to how you selected the parameters, but using the Gates folder of
            the limited browser.

            The  buttons at the bottom of the editor are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>  Click this to create the gate and dismiss the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Accept</b> Click this to create the gate and leave the dialog up</li>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Click this to dismiss the dialog without making a new gate</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>    Clicking this displays this help message.  If you have selected
                            a different gate type, clicking help again will display the help for the
                            specific gate editor you have selected.</li>
            </ul>
