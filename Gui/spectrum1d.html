        <h1>1-d Spectrum editor</h1>
        <p>
            This is the editor for 1-d and bitmask spectra.  A 1-d spectrum is defined on a single parameter.
            You must select a spectrum name, select a parameter and describe the parameter axis of the
            histogram.  You may also optionally select a gate to apply to the spectrum.  Applying a gate
            will only allow events that satisfy the gate to increment the spectrum.
            Note that if you dont' want to create a 1-d spectrum you can change the spectrum type
            by clicking the <b>1-d</b> button and selecting a new spectrum type from the drop down
            menu.
        <p>
            At the top of the dialog we have:
            <ul>
                <li>An entry labelled <b>Spectrum Name:</b>; Type the name of the spectrum you
                    are creating here.</li>
                <li>Some text that will display any gate you may want to apply to the spectrum.
                    the spectrum specific editors will give you the opportunity to supply a gate</li>
                <li>An array checkbox.  If you build a 1-d spectrum from a treeparameter array element,
                    you can create an entire array of spectra, one on each element of the array if this
                    is checked</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of the dialog we have a limited object browser.  This browser makes the
            parameters, and gates available.
            <ul>
                <li>Double clicking on a parameter selects it for use on the spectrum's parameter axis.
                    If you accidently select the wrong parameter, simply double-click a different parameter.
                    If the parameter you choose is a tree-parameter suggested axis limits and binning
                    will be given, as well as the parameter units of measure.  You can override the limits
                    and binning by typing new values in the <b>Low</b>, <b>High</b>, and <b>Bins</b> entries.
                    Note when creating a bitmask spectrum you will almost always have to modify the
                    limits and binning.  Usually Low = 0, Hihgh = 31, bins = 32 is correct.
                </li>
                <li>Double clicking a gate applies it to the spectrum.  If you select the wrong gate
                    by mistake, double click a new gate.  If you decide not to gate the spectrum,
                    double click the gate name in the top part of the dialog.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons that are avaialable at the bottom of the dialog are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>     Creates the new spectrum as described and dismisses the dialog</li>
                <li><b>Accept</b> Creates the new spectrum but leaves the dialog up to allow you to
                                  create more spectra.
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Cancels spectrum creation and dismisses the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Brings up this help dialog</li>
            </ul>
            If you attempt to create a spectrum that already exists, you will be prompted to
            confirm.  If you accept, the existing spectrum will be deleted before the new one is created.
