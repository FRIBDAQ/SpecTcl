        <h1>Applying a Gate to Multiple Spectra</h1>
        <p>
            If you see terminology in this help that is unfamiliar, it may be
            defined or explained in <a href="Vocabulary.html">the glossary page</a>.
        <p>
            This dialog allows you to apply a specific gate to one or more spectra.
            The gate applied is the gate whoe context menu you clicked.  The name of this
            gate is shown on the dialog in the upper right side.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dialog consists of three sections:
            <ul>
                <li>A limited browser restricted to the top level detail of the spectra.</li>
                <li>A listbox at the right side that shows which spectra have been selected by you
                    The selected spectra will be those on which the gate is applied</li>
                <li>At the bottom a set of three buttons, from left to right:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Ok</b> when clicked applies the gate to the spectra listed in the listbox
                        at the right of the dialog</li>
                    <li><b>Cancel</b> Dismisses the dialog without doing anything </li>
                    <li><b>Help</b> Brings up this help information</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a spectrum to the set of spectra the gate will be applied to, double click it on the
            browser.  The spectrum will be added to the end of the list box, and removed from the browser.
            If you make an error and add the wrong spectrum to the list box, just double click it in the
            listbox to remove it and send it back to the browser.
        </p>
