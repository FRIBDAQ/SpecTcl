        <h1>Editing a 2-d gate</h1>
        <p align="center">

        </p>
        <p>
            You can enter band, contours, and their gamma equivalents using Xamine by displaying
            a spectrum with the appropriate parameters and clickingo n the <b>Band</b> or
            <b>Contour </b> button and then clicking the points in on the spectrum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assuming you still want to enter a gate non-graphically using this editor;  The left
            side of the editor is an object browser limited to Parameters.  The right side
            contains listboxes of both the parameters accepted and the points, as well as a set
            of widgets for entering, and deleting points.
        </p>
        <p>
            The non gamma gates only allow you to select a pair of parameters.  When you do so,
            the first parameter is the X-axis parameter, while the second the Y-axis parameter. If you
            attempt to select more than two parameters, the least recently selected parameter is
            deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
            To select a parameter, double click it in the object browser.  An incorrectly selected
            parameter can be removed from the Parameters listbox by double clicking it.
        </p>
        <p>
            To enter a point, enter its x/y coordinates in parameter space separated by whitespace.
            Either hit the enter key or click on the <b>Accept Point</b> button to add the point to the
            X-Y points list box.  To remove the most recent point, click the <b>Delete Last</b> button.
            to remove any other point, double click it on the X-Y poinst list box.
            Note that bands require at least two points and contours require at least three points.
        <p>
            The  buttons at the bottom of the editor are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>  Click this to create the gate and dismiss the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Accept</b> Click this to create the gate and leave the dialog up</li>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Click this to dismiss the dialog without making a new gate</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>    Clicking this displays this help message.  If you have selected
                            a different gate type, clicking help again will display the help for the
                            specific gate editor you have selected.</li>
            </ul>
