        <h1>Attaching a pipe data source</h1>
        <h2><font color="red">Warning - this dialog is for experts</font></h2>
        <p>
            This dialog allows you to attach the output of a program or script as
            a SpecTcl data source.  It is very important that the script or program you
            choose will produce correctly formatted NSCL Data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the top part of the dialog to select the script or program you will run.
            Type in any relevant parameters in the bottom part of the dialog.  Note that all
            pathnames should be absolute since you cannot make any assumptions about the working
            directory.  Note as well that &#126; expansion will not be done on the parameters.
        </p>
        <h2>Example:  Analyzing a compressed event file</h2>
        <p>
            Suppose you have compressed an event file with gzip and stored it in
            <br><br>/user/0400x/stagearea/compressed/run15-4096.evt.gz
            <br><br>To analyze this run, select the command /bin/gzip and use as parameters:
            <br><br><tt>-cd /user/0400x/stagarea/compressed/run15-4096.evt.gz</tt>
            <br><br>SpecTcl will analyze this data directly from the compressed file.
        </p>
