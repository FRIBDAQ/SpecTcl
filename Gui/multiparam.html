        <h1>Multiparameter Spectrum Editor</h1>
        <p>
            This editor is used to build spectra that do not have a 1 to one correlation
            between their axes and the spectrum parameters.  The spectra you can create with
            this editor are:
            <ul>
                <li>Gamma 1-d spectra which increment a channel for each spectrum parameter
                    valid in the event</li>
                <li>Gamma 2-d spectra which increment an X/Y channel for each pair of spectrum
                    parameters valid in the event </li>
                <li>Summary spectra which assign an X channel to each parameter in the spectrum,
                    and use the y axis to create a set of 1-d spectra for each parameter in the spectrum.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of the dialog we have:
            <ul>
                <li>An entry labelled <b>Spectrum Name:</b>; Type the name of the spectrum you
                    are creating here.</li>
                <li>Some text that will display any gate you may want to apply to the spectrum.
                    the spectrum specific editors will give you the opportunity to supply a gate</li>
                <li>An array checkbox.  If you build a 1-d spectrum from a treeparameter array element,
                    you can create an entire array of spectra, one on each element of the array if this
                    is checked</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle part of the spectrum we have:
            <ul>
                <li>An object browser that is limited to parameters and gates.</li>
                <li>A list box showing the set of parameters that have been selected for the spectrum</li>
                <li>One or more axis definition boxes that allow you to enter axis limits and binning
                    for each parameter axis (the X axis of a summary spectrum is not a parameter axis).
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            To select a parameter, double click it in the browser.  If you select the wrong parameter by
            mistake, double click it in the parameters list box.  Note that since multi parameter spectra
            are usually created on parameters with similar properties, all axis definitions default to those
            suggested by the first parameter in the list box.  You may override these suggestions by
            entering new low, high and bins values on a per-axis basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Double clicking a gate applies it to the spectrum.  If you select the wrong gate
            by mistake, double click a new gate.  If you decide not to gate the spectrum,
            double click the gate name in the top part of the dialog.
        </p>
            The buttons that are avaialable at the bottom of the dialog are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>     Creates the new spectrum as described and dismisses the dialog</li>
                <li><b>Accept</b> Creates the new spectrum but leaves the dialog up to allow you to
                                  create more spectra.
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Cancels spectrum creation and dismisses the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Brings up this help dialog</li>
            </ul>
            If you attempt to create a spectrum that already exists, you will be prompted to
            confirm.  If you accept, the existing spectrum will be deleted before the new one is created.
