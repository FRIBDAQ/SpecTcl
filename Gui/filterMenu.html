        <p>SpecTcl is capable of pre-filtering data into <em>filtered data sets</em>.  A filtered data set is the
           result of applying a gate to all events and then selecting a subset of parameters to write to the
           filtered data set for each event that satisfieds the gate.</p>
        <p>The Filters menu provides utilities that allow you to create filters, selectively enable filters and
           process filter files.  Note that processing filter files requires a version of SpecTcl that has had
           its raw event unpackers removed from the event processing pipeline.  See the SpecTcl online manual
           for more information about this.</p>

        <h3>Filter Wizard</h3>
            <p>Filters are SpecTcl objects that create filtered data sets.  A filter is a named object that
               consists of:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>A gate  that is used to determine which events make it to the filtered data set.</li>
                    <li>A list of parameters that are written to the filtered data set for each event that
                        satisfies the filter's gate</li>
                    <li>A file into which the filtered data set is written</li>
                    <li>A state <em>enabled</em> or <em>disabled</em> which determines whether or not
                        a filter is actively creating a filtered data set</li>
               </ul>
            <p>The Filters-&gt;Filter Wizard... command provides a step by step gui for creating filters.
                You are promtped graphically for a filter name, the filter gate, the set of parameters to
                write to the associated filter data set and a file to which to write the filtered data set.  Note
                that if you write an existing file, this data <em><font color="red">replaces</font></em> the
                existing data set rather than appending to it.  The file prompter also allows you to check
                a button to enable the filter.

        <h3>Filter Enables</h3>
            <p>Filters can be enabled or disabled.  Only enabled filters are allowed to write to their filter
                data set files.  The Filters-&gt;Enables... command allows you to select which filters are
                enabled or disabled.  The filter definitions are listed in tabular form.  Each filter definition
                has a checkbox that you may click on to toggle its state between enabled or disabled.</p>

        <h3>Read Filter File</h3>
            <p>The Filters-&gt;Read Filter File... menu allows you to process a filter file.
                for information about reading filter files, see
