        <h1>Set the Filter File</h1>
        <p>
            Filters need an output file and can be created either enabled or disabled.
            The output file is the file to which filtered events will be written.  An
            enabled filter processes data and writes filtered events to an output file.
            Disabled filters do not process data and will not write to an output file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top part of this stage of the filter wizard allows you to select a filter
            output file. <font color="red">Warning</font> if you chose an existing file, the
            file will be overwritten, rather than appended.   The checkbox labelled <b>Active</b>
            allows you to determine if the filter starts out enabled or not.  If the <b>Active</b>
            checkbox is checked, the filter will start out enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons at the bottom of the wizard have the following functions:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Dismisses the wizard without creating a new filter.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b> Displays this help message</li>
                <li><b>Back</b> Returns to the previous step of the filter wizard (selecting
                                filter parameters></li>
                <li><b>Finish</b> Creates the filter you have used the wizard to describe</li>
            </ul>
