        <h1>Gate Menu</h1><a name="top" />
            <p>The gate menu allows you to manipulate SpecTcl gates.
               SpecTcl gates are used to conditionalize the increment of spectra
               to which they have been <em>applied</em>.  Gates are also used to
               determine which events will be written to
               <a href="filterMenu.html">filtered data sets</a>.</p>

        <h3>Create</h3>
        <p>
            The Gate-&gt;Create... command prompts you graphically to create a new
            gate.  Note that many simple gate types (slices, contours, bands and their
            gamma counterparts) can be entered graphically on the displayer window.  This
            menu is best used to create compound gates (and, or, not for example).
        </p>
        <p>
            The command prompts for a gate name and gate type.  When the gate type has been selected,
            the appropriate gate editor is displayed to allow you to define the gate.
        </p>
            <br><br><a href="#top">Top</a>
        <h3>Apply</h3>
            <p>The Gate-&gt;Apply... command allows you to select a gate to apply to several spectra.
                once applied, the spectra will only increment for events that satisfy the gate.
            </p>
            <br><br><a href="#top">Top</a>
        <h3>Delete</h3>
            <p>
                The Gate-&gt;Delete... command allows you to delete a gate.  In reality deleted gates are just
                turned into gates that are always false.  This has some implications for gates that depend on
                the gate that has been deleted, but probably these are not as bad as other choices for what to do
                with a deleted gate.
