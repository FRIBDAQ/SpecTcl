        <h1>Strip chart spectrum editor</h1>
        <p>
            This is the stripchart spectrum editor.  A stipchart spectrum describes the
            evolution of the value of one parameter as a function of the other.  Traditionally,
            the dependent parameter is called the <em>Value parameter</em> while the independent parameter
            is called the <em>time</em> axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of the dialog we have:
            <ul>
                <li>An entry labelled <b>Spectrum Name:</b>; Type the name of the spectrum you
                    are creating here.</li>
                <li>Some text that will display any gate you may want to apply to the spectrum.
                    the spectrum specific editors will give you the opportunity to supply a gate</li>
                <li>An array checkbox.  If you build a 1-d spectrum from a treeparameter array element,
                    you can create an entire array of spectra, one on each element of the array if this
                    is checked</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The middle of the dialog features an object browser limited to the parameters and gates at
            the left side, and a box containing the time axis and value axis information at the right
            side.
        </p>
        <p>
            At any time, one of these axes is highlighted indicating which parameter you are
            picking next.  If you want to change the highlighting, click on the name field of the parameter
            you want to highlight.
        </p>
        <p>
            To select a parameter, double click it in the parameter part of the browser.  If you selected
            the wrong parameter:
            <ol>
                <li>Click the name of the parameter in the axis description box to highlight it.</li>
                <li>Double click the correct parameter in the browser to replace the incorrect one.</li>
            </ol>
            If the time axis is a tree parameter, axis range and bins will be selected.  Note that the axis
            range is only the initial axis range.   Once the upper time axis limit is exceeded,
            the spectrum will scroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            Double clicking a gate applies it to the spectrum.  If you select the wrong gate
            by mistake, double click a new gate.  If you decide not to gate the spectrum,
            double click the gate name in the top part of the dialog.
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons that are avaialable at the bottom of the dialog are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>     Creates the new spectrum as described and dismisses the dialog</li>
                <li><b>Accept</b> Creates the new spectrum but leaves the dialog up to allow you to
                                  create more spectra.
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Cancels spectrum creation and dismisses the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Brings up this help dialog</li>
            </ul>
            If you attempt to create a spectrum that already exists, you will be prompted to
            confirm.  If you accept, the existing spectrum will be deleted before the new one is created.
