        <h1>Applying a gate to a spectrum</h1>
        <p>
            This dialog prompts you to apply a gate to a spectrum.  If the
            specrum is already gated, this gate supersedes any existing gate.
            The left hand part of this window is an <a href="Browser.html">Object Browser</a>
            that is restricted to showing only the names of gates and their types.
            Double click on a gate to select it.
        </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Click cancel to leave everything unchanged.</li>
                <li>Click help for this help page</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Note that while this dialog is up you can still interact with the main browser window
            if you need to get information that is not available from the restricted browser in this
            dialog
