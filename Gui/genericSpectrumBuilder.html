        <h1>Spectrum Builder</h1>
        <p>
            This is the generic spectrum builder.  First select a spectrum type
            by clicking the <b>Spectrum Type</b> button and choosing a spectrum type from
            the menu that will drop down.  This will convert the middle part of the dialog
            into a spectrum type specific editor.  If you click help on the resulting dialog,
            you will get help specific to creating that spectrum type.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of the dialog we have:
            <ul>
                <li>An entry labelled <b>Spectrum Name:</b>; Type the name of the spectrum you
                    are creating here.</li>
                <li>Some text that will display any gate you may want to apply to the spectrum.
                    the spectrum specific editors will give you the opportunity to supply a gate</li>
                <li>An array checkbox.  If you build a 1-d spectrum from a treeparameter array element,
                    you can create an entire array of spectra, one on each element of the array if this
                    is checked</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons that are avaialable at the bottom of the dialog are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Cancels spectrum creation and dismisses the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Brings up this help dialog</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
