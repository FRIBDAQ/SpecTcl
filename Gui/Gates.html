        <p>
            If you com across terms that are not familiar to you, please have a look at the

        <p>
            Gates are stored within the Gates top level folder.  The top level folder has a context
            menu that is activated when ou right click the folder.  Gates themselves have both a
            right click activated context menu and a double-click activated selection action.
        </p>
        <h2>Top level Gate folder context menu</h2>
            <p>
                Right clicking the top level Gates folder brings up a context menu that has the
                following commands:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>New...</b> Allows you to use the gui to create a new gate.  Note that
                            Some gates, slices, contours and bands, in particular, are probably
                            easier to enter on the displayer than through the SpecTcl GUI.</li>
                    <li><b>Refresh Tree</b>Refreshes the browser tree. Normally the tree will refresh itself as needed
                    whenever changes are made.  However if changes are made the GUI is not aware of,
                    you may need to manually refresh the tree.</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Gate object context menus</h2>
            <p>
                Gate objects have a context menu that is activated by right clicking on any gate object.
                This context menu h as the following commands:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Edit...</b> Allows you to edit the gate. </li>
                    <li><b>Apply To...</b>Allows you to apply the gate to one or more spectra</li>
                    <li><b>Delete</b>Allows you to delete the gate.  Note that in reality, gates are not deleted,
                            they are turned into false gates.  This choice was made to reduce the ripple effect
                            of deleting a gate that other gates depend on.</li>
