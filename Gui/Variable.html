        <h1>Variable context menus and selection actions</h1>
            <p>
                If you find terminology on this page that is unfamiliar, please

            </p>
            <p>Variables are stored in the Variables top level folder.  A variable
                object represents a Treevariable which is a Tcl variable that has
                a name reflecting its hierarchical position a structure maintained
                within the user's program and an associated, optional units of measure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The top level Variables folder has a context menu.  Variables themselves have a
                selection action, but on context menu
            </p>
            <h2>The Variable folder context menu</h2>
            <p>
                The variable folder context menu has a single entry: <b>Refresh Tree</b>
                which refreshes the browser tree. Normally the tree will refresh itself as needed
                    whenever changes are made.  However if changes are made the GUI is not aware of,
                    you may need to manually refresh the tree.</li>
            </p>
            <h2> Variable object selection actions</h2>
            <p>
                When double clicked, the selection action of a variable is to allow you to modify its values
                and units.
