        <h1><a name="spectrumInfo" />Information available from spectra </h1>
            <p>
                Opening a spectrum will reveal details about a spectrum that depend on the
                spectrum type.  In general, all spectra will display the parameters and
                information about the range of parameter values covered by their axes
                and the number of bins on each axis.
            </p>
            <h3>1-d spectra</h3>
                <p>
                    1-d spectra provide the following information on the same line of the browser as the
                    spectrum object:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spectrum type (1 and data type of channel e.g. long).</li>
                        <li>Gate that is applied (if any).</li>
                        <li>Range of parameter covered by the X-axis and number of bins on that axis</li>
                        <li>Where applicable the units of measure of the X-axis</li>
                        <li>If the spectrum is gated, the Gate column names the gate that is applied
                            to the spectrum</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, drilling down into the spectrum will display the parameter that is
                    histogrammed.  In most cases, 1-d histograms are given names that match the names
                    of their parameter.
                </p>


            <h3>2-d spectra</h3>
                <p>
                   2-d spectra only show spectrum type and channel type information on the same line as
                   the histogram.  If the spectrum is gated, the name of the gate applied to the spectrum is
                   listed in the Gate column.
                   To see more information it is necessary to drill down into the spectrum.
                   Drilling down into the spectrum provides the following information
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            X axis description.  This includes the name of the parameter on that axis as well
                            as axis range and binning and, where applicable, the units of measure of the underlying
                            parameter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Y axis description.  Provides the same information for the Y axis as is provided
                            for the X axis.
