        <h1>Provide a Filter Name</h1>
        <p>
            All filters must have a name.  The filter name identifies the filter
            both to you, for future operations, and to SpecTcl.  While any characters can
            appear in the filter name, we recommend that you use alphanumeric characters and
            periods.  Stay clear of characters that have meaning to Tcl.
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons at the bottom of the filter wizard have the following meanings:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Cancel the creation of the filter and dismiss the wizard.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Display this help text.</li>
                <li><b>Next</b>   Continue defining the filter.</li>
            </ul>
