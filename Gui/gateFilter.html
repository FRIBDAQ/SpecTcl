        <h1>Provide the Filter Gate</h1>
        <p>
            Each filter is associated with a gate.  When the filter is enabled,
            only the events that satisfy the gate will be written to the filter file.
            This dialog prompts you for the filter's gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top part of the dialog is a limited object browser that shows you the top
            level  definitions of each gate known to SpecTcl.  Double click on a gate to select it.
            The selected gate is displayed below the browser.
            If you select the wrong gate by mistake, simply double click the correct gate to replace
            youre selection.

                                  (choosing a filter name).</li>
