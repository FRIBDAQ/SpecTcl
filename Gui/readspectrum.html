        <h1>Restoring spectrum contents from file</h1>
        <p>
            This dialog consists of three vertically stacked sections.
            The top section is a file selector.  Use it to choose the name of the file
            you are reading.  The middle is a set of three checkoxes:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Snapshot</b>  If selected, the spectrum read from file is read in such a way
                    that it will never be incremented.</li>
                <li><b>Replace existing spectra</b> If set, a spectrum that already exists will be ovewritten
                    with the data read from file.  If not, a unique spectrum name will be created based
                    on the existing spectrum name.</li>
                <li><b>Bind to Display</b> If checked, the spectrum is bound to the display</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the dialog, there are three buttons:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>  Reads the spectrum file and dismisses the dialog</li>
                <li><b>Cancel</b>  Dismisses the dialog and does nothing else.</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>   Displays this help page</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
