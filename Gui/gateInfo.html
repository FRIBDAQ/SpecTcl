        <h1><a name="gateInfo" />Information available from gates</h1>
            <p>
                SpecTcl gates are used to impose conditions that restrict when a spectrum is incremented.
                Gamma gates can be further used to create a spectrum that is folded with respect to one or more
                decay energies.  The browser line displaying each gate provides the gate type code in the
                "Type" column.   Additional gate type dependent information is available by drilling down into
                individual gates.    Gate specific information is divided into the following categories:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Slice gates</li>
                    <li>2-d gates (contours and bands)</li>
                    <li>1-d Gamma gates</li>
                    <li>2-d Gamma gates (gamma contours and gamma bands)</li>
                    <li>Bitmask gates (And mask, equal mask, not mask)</li>
                    <li>Compound gates (and, or and not gates)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Note that constant gates (true and false), don't have any additional information and therefore
                cannot be drilled into</p>
            <h3>Slice gates</h3>
                <p>
                    Slice gates display their gate type code "s" in the Type column.  Drilling down provides
                    the following information:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The parameter the gate is defined on</li>
                        <li>The values of the parameter that define the lower and upper limits of the slice</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>2-d gates (contours and bands)</h3>
                <p>
                    2-d gates provide their gate type code on the same line as the object in the Type column.
                    Contour gates are type "c" while band gates are of type "b".  These gates type both provide
                    the following information when drilled into.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the X parameter on which the gate is defined (named as
                            "X : <em>parameter name</em>"</li>
                        <li>The name of the Y parameter on which the gate is defined (named as
                            "Y : <em>parameter name</em>"</li>
                        <li>A folder named Points.  When opened, this folder provides the <em>x/y</em> coordinates
                            of the points that describe the gate boundaries.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>1-d gamma gates </h3>
                <p>
                   1-d gamma gates provide their gate type on the same line as the object in the Type column.
                   The type code of a gamma slice is "gs".  Drilling into a gamma slice gate provides the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A folder named "Parameters" which, when opened, lists the parameters on which the
                          gate was defined.</li>
                    <li>The lower and upper limits of the gate.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>2-d gamma gates </h3>
                <p>
                    A 2d gamma gate can either be a gamma contour or a gamma slice.  2d gamma gates
                    display their gate type code (gc for gamma contour, gs for gamma slices) on the
                    same line as the gate.  Drilling into the gate provides:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A folder named "Parameters" that, when opened, lists the parameters on which the
                          gate was set.</li>
                    <li>A folder named "Points" that, when opened, lists the points that define the gate
                          shape.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Bitmask gates   </h3>
                <p>
                    Bitmask gates provide their type code on the same line as the gate.
                    There are three types of bitmask gates:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>am - and mask gates, A parameter is bitwise anded with a mask.  If the result is equal
                            to the mask, the gate is satisfied.</li>
                        <li>em - equal mask gates, If the parameter is bitwise the same as the mask, the
                            gate is satisfied.</li>
                        <li>nm - not mask gates,  The parameter is anded with the bitwise comlement of the mask.
                            If the result is equal to the mask, the gate is satisfied.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Drilling into a bitmask gate provides:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the parameter on which the gate was set.</li>
                        <li>The value of the bitmask</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Compound gates  </h3>
                <p>
                    A compound gate is a gate that is dependent on other gates.  Each compound gate
                    lists its gate type in the Type column on the same line as the gate in the browser
                    (* for and gates, + for or gates, and - for not gates).  Drilling into the gate
                    provides the list of gates that the gates depends on.
