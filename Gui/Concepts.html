        <h1>SpecTcl GUI Browser Concepts</h1>
        <p>
            The SpecTcl Gui revolves around a hierarchical browser of the
            SpecTcl <a href="Objects.html">Objects</a>.  The browser allows you
            both to drill down to any desired level of detail about the hierarchy
            as well as to directly manipulate elements of the hieararchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of the SpecTcl object types is stored in a top level folder in the hiearchy.
            Opening this folder reveals subfolders and objects.  The objects themselves may be opened
            to show their detailed definition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Direct manipulation is performed via <em>context menus</em> and <em>selection actions</em>.
            A <em>context menu</em> is
            a menu that is associated with a right click over an object.  Top level folders and all objects
            have context menus associated with them that allow you to do the most common operations on the
            item.  A <em>selection action</em> is a double click over an object (in general folders do not have
            selection actions.  The selection action for an object usually will allow you to edit the
            definition of an object.
