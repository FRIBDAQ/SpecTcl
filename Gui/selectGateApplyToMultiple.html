                    top of this area is the selected gate. At the bottom of this area, a list of spectra
                    selected.</li>
                <li>An area at the bottom of the dialog that contains buttons named:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Ok</b> when clicked this button applies the gate you have selected to the
                            set of spectra in the listbox, and dismisses the dialog.</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>

        </p>

            to replace your current selection.
