        <h1>Editing Compound Gates</h1>
        <p>
            A compound gate is a gate that depends on other gates.
            The particular gate type you are editing is shown in the button
            at the upper left of the dialog. To the right of that is an entry
            in which you can type the name of the gate you are creating/editing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The editor proper consists of a limited object browser on the left side and a list box
            on the right.  The browser
            shows top level information about all gates.   The listbox displays the gates you have already
            accepted.  Note that if the gate can only accept a limited number of gates, adding a new gate
            to the dependency list will remove the least recently added gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a gate to the dependency list, double click it in the browser.  If you have added the
            wrong gate to the list, double click the gate in the listbox to remove it and return it to
            the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The  buttons at the bottom of the editor are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ok</b>  Click this to create the gate and dismiss the dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Accept</b> Click this to create the gate and leave the dialog up</li>
                <li><b>Cancel</b> Click this to dismiss the dialog without making a new gate</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>    Clicking this displays this help message.  If you have selected
                            a different gate type, clicking help again will display the help for the
                            specific gate editor you have selected.</li>
            </ul>
