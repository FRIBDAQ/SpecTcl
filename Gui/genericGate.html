        <h1>Generic Gate Editor</h1>
        <p>
            This is the generic gate editor.  The Gate name entry allows you
            to specify a name for the gate you are creating.  Either before or after
            doing this, you should click the button labelled <b>Gate Type</b> to pop up
            a menu of the sorts of gates this editor can create/edit.  Select the appropriate
            gate type and the editor for it will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two enabled buttons at the bottom of the editor are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cancel</b>  Click this to dismiss the dialog without creating a new Gate</li>
                <li><b>Help</b>    Clicking this displays this help message.  If you have selected
                            a gate type, clicking help again will display the help for the
                            specific gate editor you have selected.</li>
            </ul>
