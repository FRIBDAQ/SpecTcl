This tarball is a SpecTcl plugin that adds the ability for
SpecTcl filters to write root ntuple files. This is not
standalone software.  At a minimum, you will need SpecTcl and 
Root installed on the target system.

See COPYING for license terms,
See INSTALL for installation instructions.

To use; assuming you installed the plugin in SpecTcl's installation tree
The folowing command (scripted in SpecTclRC.tcl is probably best) loads the
plugin:

load $SpecTclHome/TclLibs/librootfilterformat.so

To have a filter 'myfilter' write an ntuple file;
1. Ensure the filter is disabled.
2. filter -format myfilter rootntuple

Set the filter file and enable it as any other filter.
When you disable the filter, or change the filename,
the NTuple that has been accumulating will be written to disk.
The name of the ntuple will be "spectcl"  the parameters in the ntuple will
be the same as the spectcl parameter names.  This implies, if you know root,
that you should avoid parameters with names that have colons as NTuple 
descriptors use colons to separate parameter names.

Suppose you wrote a root filter name rootfilter.root 
with parameters a.b.c and a.b.d in it, and that these
parameters have the range 0-4095.
In root:

TFile     f("rootfilter.root");    // Opens the file.
TNtuple* nt = f.Get("spectcl");    // Loads the ntuple.
nt.Draw("a.b.c", 
        "(a.b.c >= 0.0) && (a.b.c < 4096)"); // Plot a.b.c
nt.Draw("a.b.c:a.b.d", 
        "(a.b.c < 4096) && (a.b.d < 4096");  // Plot 2d.

Those with more root knowlege than I can make a fancier example.
