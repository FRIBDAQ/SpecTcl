<ul>
<li>2-d sum spectra have been added. These are a multiply incremented
   2-d spectrum. See the <a href="Commands/spectrum.htm">spectrum</a>
   documentation for more informatino</li>
<li>A buffer processing framework has been added to SpecTcl.  This framework
   can be used independently of SpecTcl to do ad-hoc analysis of NSCL
   structured event files. For more information about this, see 
   <A HREF="programmers_guide.htm">the programming guide.</A></li>
<li>Man pages are being added for new stuff.  If SpecTcl is installed in 
    SpecTclHome, the man pages wil be in SpecTclHome/man </li>
<li>Event processing software has been written that allows you to access
    scaler data and control buffer data from analysis of NSCL formatted data
    buffers.  Since this is NSCL buffer format specific, you will have to
    explicitly enable this.  See the  <A HREF="programmers_guide.htm">the
   programming guide.</A> for information on how to do this.</li>
<li>Event processing software has been written that allows you to recover run
      variables and run state variables that are created by the production
      readout skeleton.  This mechanism allows you, in conjunction with the
      controlpush program, to recover control system data from within SpecTcl.
      See the <a href="programmers_guide.htm"> the programming guide </a> for
      more information on how to do this.
 </li>
 <li>
	The TreeParameter package contributed by Daniel Bazin has been
	completely integrated with SpecTcl-3.0.   For more information about
	this, see <a href="treeparam/TreeParameter.html"> the tree parameter documentation</a>
 </li>
 <li>
 All listing commands now support glob patterns.
 </li>
 <li>
 New gate types to support bit mask gates are now available.  See
 <a href="Commands/gate.htm">the gate command documentation</a> for more information
 about these new gates.
 </li>
 <li>
 The handling of gamma spectra and gamma gates has been redone to better support
 gamma particle coincidence data.  Gamma gates can be applied to spectra or
 serve in combination with other gates (e.g  particle id and gamma gate).
 Gamma spectra now support a <em>fold</em> which serves the function previously
 served by gamma gates.  See the <a href="Commands/gate.htm">gate</a> and
 <a href="Commands/fold.htm">fold</a> command documentation for more information 
 about these concepts.
 </LI>
