<ul>
  <li>SpecTcl 3.1 (actually SpecTcl-3.0-010 and later) run correctly
      on 64 bit linux x86 systems.</li>
  <li>A new graphical user interface for SpecTcl has been written.
      This interface has much greater functionality and is somewhat more
      user friendly than the classic TreeParameter GUI (which remains
      available but should be considered stable and mature).  The
      Skeleton SpecTclRC.tcl file will start the new GUI.  You can
      start this new GUI from existing SpecTclRC.tcl files by
      changing the line
      <pre>
source $SpecTclHome/TopGui.tcl
      </pre>
      to
      <pre>
source $SpecTclHome/newGui.tcl
      </pre>
      The new GUI documnetation is in the Help-&gt;Topics menu entry in
      the GUI main window and is quite extensive.
   </li>
   <li>
      SpecTcl now can create projection spectra.  Projection spectra can
      be either static snapshots, SpecTcl will make a best effort to define
      the spectrum to increment as a faithful representation of the projection
      requested.  For more information see the 
      <a href="Commands/project.htm">project</a> command documentation page.
   </li>
   <li>
      2-d Spectra can now have channels that are a longword wide (this is now
      the default).  This allows channels to have up to 4 billion counts
      (unsigned).
   </li>
   <li>
      The <a href="Commands/treeparameter.htm">treeparam</a> and
      <a href="Commands/treevariable.htm">treevariable</a> commands have
      had some additional capabilities added, these are mostly intended to
      support the new GUI.
   </li>
   <li>
      The <a href="Commands/attach.htm">attach</a> command has a new option
      <em>-list</em> that allows you to obtain information about the current
      SpecTcl event source.  While this was added primarily for the
      new GUI it is available for use within your application specific scripts.
   </li>
   <li>
     Xamine and SpecTcl now cooperate to title spectra with information
    about the definition of the Spectrum that is being displayed.
   </li>
</ul>
