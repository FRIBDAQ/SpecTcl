    The event processing pipeline provides an ordered set of event processors
    to the SpecTcl analyzer.  The main duty of the event processing pipeline
    is to convert a raw event into a set of event parameters from which
    histogramming then proceeds.
    Event processors are described in detail <a href='eventprocessor.htm'>here</a>

    </ol>
<p>
    
<h2 id='create_analysis_pipline'>Creating the initial analysis pipeline</h2>

<p>
    SpecTcl provides a file <tt>MySpecTclApp.cpp</tt> as part of the
    <a href='obtainin.htm'>skeleton code you obtain</a> when you start the
    tailoring process.   This file defines and instantiates an object
    <tt>CMySpecTclApp</tt> that has methods that are called at specific
    points in the initialization process.
</p>
<p>
    One of these methods is <tt>CreateAnalysisPipeline</tt>.  This is called
    early in SpecTcl's initialization.  This method can be used to set up an
    initial analysis pipeline.  The base class of
    <tt>CMySpecTclApp</tt> provides a method, <tt>RegisterEventProcessor</tt>,
    for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <tt>RegisterEventProcessor</tt> adds an event processor to the end of the
    analysis pipeline. Its argument signature is:
</p>
<pre>
void RegisterEventProcessor(CEventProcessor&amp; rEventProcessor,
    const char* name = 0);    
</pre>

<ul>
    <li><tt>rEventProcessor</tt> is a reference to an event processor object
        you want added to the pipeline.
    </li>
    <li><tt>name</tt> is an optional name to assign to this event processor.
        If omitted or a null pointer a n ame will be chosen by SpecTcl.
        The name can be used in <a href='#api'>API</a> calls to loate the
        event processor in the future, provided all event processors
        are given unique names.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, suppose you have an event procesosr class EP and want
    to register an instance of it in the event processing pipelien.
    You could:
</p>
<pre>
    RegisterEventProcessor(*(new EP), "anEP");
</pre>


<h2 id='api'>Dynamically manipulating the event processor pipeline</h2>

<p>
    The SpecTcl API allows you to dynamically manipulate the event processing
    pipeline.  SpecTcl plugins such as the calibrated parameter plugin use this
    API to register event processors as they load.
</p>
<p>
    In <a href='#delayload'>the next section</a> of this page we'll see how
    to use the API and a little trick to get event processors loaded that might
    depend on the existence of calibrated parameters.
</p>
<p>
    This section provides an overview of the SpecTcl API's methods for
    manipulating the event processor pipeline.
</p>
<p>
    To use the SpecTcl API you will need to get a pointer or reference to the
    API object.  The code snipped below shows how to get a pointer and a reference
    to the API.  Whether you use a pointer or a reference depends on whether you
    prefer to use <tt>.</tt> or <tt>-&gt;</tt> oeprations to access methods in
    the API.
</p>
<pre>
    
    #include &lt;SpecTcl.h&gt;
    ...
    
    SpecTcl* pApi =  SpecTcl::getInstance();      // pointer
    SpecTcl&amp; rApi =  *(SpecTcl::getInstance());   // reference
    ...
</pre>
<p>
    Once you have a reference or pointer you can dereference it to invoke any
    of the following event processor pipeline manipulation methods:
</p>

<h3 id='add'>AddEventProcessor</h3>
<p>
    This method adds a new event processor at the end of the event processing
    pipeline.  The signature of this method is:
</p>
<pre>
void SpecTcl::AddEventProcessor(CEventProcessor&amp; eventProcessor, const char* name = 0);
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>eventProcessor</tt> parameter is a reference to a new event processor
object to add and <tt>name</tt> is an optional name to give the event processor.
</p>
<p>
    To add an event processor at a position other than the beginning of the
    pipeline see <a href='#insert'>InsertEventProcessor</a> below.
</p>

<h3>FindEventProcessor</h3>
<p>
    Locates an event processor in the event processing pipeline.  This is
    an overloaded method with two signatures as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator FindEventProcessor(std::string name);
CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator FindEventProcessor(CEventProcessor&amp; processor);
</pre>
<p>
    The first signature locates an event processor in the pipeline given its name.
    If there are several event processors with the same name, the one most
    towards the front of the pipeline is located.
</p>
<p>
    The second signature locates an event processor in the pipline by a reference
    to the object itself. For example:
</p>
<pre>
MyEventProcessor* pEp(0);
...
{
    ....
    SpecTcl* pApi = SpecTcl::getInstance();
    pEp = new MyEventProcessor;
    pApi->AddEventProcessor(*pEp, "My Event Processor);
    
    ...
}
....
{
    ...
    
    SpecTcl* pApi = SpecTcl::getInstance();
    
    // Find by name:
    
    CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator pNamed = pApi-&gt;FindEventProcessor("My Event Processor");
    
    // Find by object:
    
    CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator p = pApi-&gt;FindEventProcessor(*pEp);
}
</pre>
<p>
    The returned value is a <i>iterator</i> to the event processing pipeline.
    The <tt>CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator</tt> class is defined in
    <tt>TCLAnalyzer.h</tt> as a <tt>std::pair</tt> whose first element is the
    name of the event processor an whose second element is a pointer to the
    event processor object.
</p>
<p>
    If the event processor cannot be found in the pipeline, the same value
    returned from <a href='#end'>ProcessingPipelineEnd()</a> is returned.
    So for example:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    SpecTcl* pApi = SpecTcl::getInstance();
    
    TclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator p = pApi=&gt;FindEventProcessor("My Processor");
    if (p == pApi-&gt;ProcessingPipelineEnd()) {
       std::cerr << "'My Processor' is not in the event processing pipeline\n;
    } else {
       std::cerr << "Found '" << p->first << "'\n";
    }
</pre>

<p>
    If you are not familiar with the concept of iterators have a look at the
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator'>Wikipedia article</a>
    on iterators.  Another good source is sections 2.3 and chapter 4 of
    Mussser, Derge and Saini's <u>STL Tutorial and Reference Guide</u>
    (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series 2001 ISBN 0-201-37923-6).
</p>

<h3 id='insert'>InsertEventProcessor</h3>
<p>
    This method allows you to insert an event processor before any element in
    the pipeline.  The signature of this method is:
</p>
<pre>
void InsertEventProcessor(
    CEventProcessor&amp; processor, CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator where, const char*  name = 0
);    
</pre>
<p>
    <tt>processor</tt> is a reference to the event processor to add.
    <tt>where</tt> is an iterator that 'points' to an element of the pipeline
    after which to add the event processor. <tt>name</tt> is the name to
    assign to the new pipeline element.
</p>

<p>
  The example below adds an element before the element named <tt>after</tt>.
  If there is no such element, nothing is done.
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    SpecTcl* pApi = SpecTcl::getInstance();
    TclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator p = pApi-&gt;FindEventProcessor("after";
    if (p != pApi-&gt;ProcessingPipelineEnd()) {
       pApi-&gt;InsertEventProcessor(*(new MyEventProcessor), p, "prior");
    }
</pre>

<p>
    Note that you can insert an element at the beginning of the event procsssing
    pipeline by using the iterator returned by <a href='#begin'>ProcessingPipelineBegin</a>
    as well.  Using the <a href='#end'>ProcessingPipelineEnd</a> iterator allows
    you to insert items at the end (as does
    <a href='#add'>AddEventProcessor</a>).
    )
</p>
    
<h3>RemoveEventProcessor</h3>
<p>
    Removes an event processor fromt he processing pipeline.  This has two
    forms:
</p>
<pre>
void RemoveEventProcessor(CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator here);    
void RemoveEventProcessor(std::string name);
</pre>
<p>
   The first of these removes an event processor given an interator to it.
   The second is a convenience method that finds the event processor
   named <tt>name</tt> and removes it.  The second method is a no-op if
   handed a <tt>name</tt> that does not correspond to an event processor.
</p>

<p>
    The example below shows a use case for using the first method:
</p>
<pre>
CMyEventProcessor* pEp(0);
{
    ...
    SpecTcl* pApi = SpecTcl::getInstance();
    pEp           = new CMyEventProcessor();
    pApi-&gt;AddEventProcessor(*pEp);   // We don't know the name of this.
    
    ....
    
    
    // But now we want to delete it and we don't know it's name:
    
    CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator p = pApi-&gt;FindEventProcessor(*pEp);
    pApi-&gt;RemoveEventProcessor(p);
    delete pEp;
}
</pre>

<h3>ProcessingPipelineSize</h3>
<p>
    Returns the number of elements in the event processing pipeline.   The
    signature of this method is:
</p>
<pre>
UInt_t ProcessingPipelineSize()
</pre>
<h3 id='begin'>ProcessingPipelineBegin</h3>
<p>
    Returns an iterator that 'points' to the first element of the event
    processing pipeline.  The signature of this method is:
</p>
<pre>
CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator ProcessingPipelineBegin()
</pre>
<h3 id='end'>ProcessingPipelineEnd()</h3>

<p>
    Returns an iterator that is beyond the last element of the pipeline.
    If an iterator is equal to the value returned by this method it is not
    in the pipeline.  Doing an insert using this iterator is the same as appending
    to the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
    The signature for this method is:
</p>
<pre>
CTclAnalyzer::EventProcessorIterator ProcessingPipelineEnd()
</pre>

<h2 id='delayload'>Loading event processors after initialization</h2>

<p>
    Sometimes you need to load an event processor at a time that's not convenient
    to what is directly supported in the preceding discussion.   Suppose, for
    example, you SpecTcl registers some event processors that produce raw parameters
    and you the, in <tt>SpecTclRC.tcl</tt> load the calibrated parameter
    plug-in and use it produce parameters that have physically meaningful value.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose further you want to add an event processor that uses those calibrated
    parameters (e.g. to compute an energy sum).  It can be a bit hard to see how to
    do this.
</p>
<p>
    One simple trick is to have an event processor whose purpose on life is to
    register another event processor.  The key to this working is that calibparam
    registers a single event processor at load time which computes all calibrated
    parameters that are defined.  This means that once the <tt>SpecTclRC.tcl</tt>
    has done the <tt>load</tt> command to load the plugin, the event processor
    is registered and another one can be registered that can make use of parameters
    computed by the plugin.
</p>
<p>
    Another key is to use the <a href='tree.htm'>tree parameter package</a> to
    bind variables to named parameters so you don't need to know which parameter
    the calibrated parameters are bound to.
</p>
<p>
    You can provide and register
    an event processor that only implements <tt>OnInitialize</tt>.
    In <tt>OnInitialize</tt> you will create and register an instance
    of the event processor that depends on the calibrated parameters.
    The <a href='#api'>API functions</a> described in the previous section
    describe how to do this.
</p>

<p>
    Another alternative is to write a plugin that is loaded later.
    Writing plugins is beyond the scope of this page.  Plugins, however
    are just shared object libraries that can be loaded via the Tcl
    <tt>load</tt> commmand.  As part of their load process, Tcl
    invokes an initialization function which can get access to the
    <a href='#api'>SpecTcl API</a> and register additional event processors.
</p>
<p>
    For more information about this approach see the Tcl manpage on the
    load command (e.g at this time at <a href='http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/load.htm'>
    The Tcl website</a>
