    SpecTcl does not know anything about the format of your data.  It relies
    on your code to unpack raw events into <i>parameters</i>.  Gates are checked
    on and histograms incremented from parameter values.
    This page describes
    <ul>
        <li><a href='#pipe'>The SpecTcl event processing pipeline</a></li>
        <li><a href='#processors'>How to write event processors which are the elements of the event
            processing pipeline.</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <a href='pipeline.htm'>This page</a> describes how to setup the event
    processing pipeline once you've written all your event processors.
</p>

<h2 id='pipe'>The Event processing pipeline</h2>
<p>
    Experiments are often built from several detetor systems.  Furthermore,
    analysis of experiments often proceeds by successive refinement.
    The SpecTcl event processing pipeline recognizes this fact.  The
    event processing pipeline allows you to perform the creation of parameters
    from raw events in an ordered list of stages called <i>Event Processors</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Each event processor has available to it the raw event as well as all
    parameters that have been created by event processors that ran prior to it.
    A recommended best practice is to have initial analysis done by a set of
    event processors that minimally transform the raw event into raw parameters.
    Subsequent stages can reference these parameters to perform more complex
    physically meaningful computed parameters.  This first set of stages
    effectively insulates the second set of stages from the structure of the
    raw event.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look at an example.   Suppose you have an experiment that consists
    of two detector systems; SeGA and the Beta endstation.  Rather than making
    a raw event processor understand everthing it needs to know about both
    detector systems, you can structure your data using NSCL Packets.  A SeGA
    event processor can search the event for a SeGA packet and unpack its raw
    parameters into an agreed upon set of parameter while a Beta End station
    event processor does the same for the Beta Endstation packet.
    (See <a href='tree.htm'> programming with tree parameters</a> for a system
    that makes agreeing on parameters easy).
</p>
<p>
    Having unpacked the raw parametesr you could then add stages to the
    event processing pipline to produce calibrated parameters (see the
    <a href='http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq/specplugins/calibparams.pdf'>calibrated
    parameter plugin however</a>).  Another event processor could produce parameters
    that require data from both detector systems and so on.
</p>



<h2 id='processors'>Writing event processors</h2>
<p>
    An event processor is a stage in the event processing pipeline.  Each
    event processor is an object from a class derived from
    <tt>CEventProcessor</tt>.  The header for that class is in
    <tt>EventProcessor.h</tt>.  The base class specification for an event
    processor provides an interface made up of virtual functions and default
    implementations of each of those virtual functions.
</p>
<p>
    In general, each virtual function returns a <tt>Bool_t</tt> value which
    must be <tt>kfTRUE</tt> to allow processing to continue with the next
    stage of the event processing pipeline and <tt>kfFALSE</tt> to abort the
    pipeline.  When event decoding is aborted, the partially decoded data
    are not histogrammed.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at the virtual functions in the interfce.  Note that you only need
    to implement the methods you need for your event processor.
</p>
<h3>OnAttach</h3>

<p>
    Event processors don't do anything until they are attached to the
    <i>Analyzer</i>.  When they are, this method is called.  A reference to
    the analyzer (<tt>CAnalyzer&</tt>) is the sole parameter of this method.
    See <tt>Analyzer.h</tt> for the facilities provided by the analyzer.
</p>
<p>
    As with all event processor processing methods, this method must return
    <tt>kfTRUE</tt>.  At present, this value is ignored however in the future
    it is possible that a <tt>kfFALSE</tt> will result in the event processor
    being removed from the event processing pipeline.
</p>
    
<h3>OnInitialize</h3>
<p>
    <tt>MySpecTclApp.cpp</tt> supports adding event processors very early in the
    SpecTcl startup.  The event processors added in
    <tt>CMySpecTclApp::CreateAnalysisPipeline</tt> are added to the pipeline
    before any SpecTcl initialization scripts have been run.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, <tt>OnInitialize</tt> is invoked for all event processors in the
    event processing pipeline once SpecTcl is fully initialized.  This method
    therefore has access to all interpreter variables that may have been set up
    by the initialization scripts as well as SpecTcl object definitions
    that may have been created by these scripts.  The method pakes no parameters
    and should return <tt>kfTRUE</tt> so that the remainder of the event
    processing pipeline elements will be processed.
</p>
<p>
    Event processors that are added dynamically after initialization is complete
    will have both their <tt>OnAttach</tt> and their <tt>OnInitialize</tt>
    methods called at that time in that order.  Therefore it is <b>not</b> necessary
    for an event processor to know if it is dynamically or statically added.
</p>

<h3 id='functor'>operator()</h3>
<p>
    This method (the function call operator) is invoked for each physics trigger
    related event.  The
    method has the following set of responsibilities (spread out over all event
    processors in the pipeline):
    <ul>
        <li>Elements of the parameter array must be filled in given the
            values in the raw event (see however <a href='tree.htm'> programming with tree parameters</a>).
        </li>
        <li>One of the event processor <tt>operator()</tt> methods must
            indicate the size of the event in bytes so that SpecTcl knows
            where to find the next event in whatever buffer it is using.
        </li>
        <li>
            If nothing terrible happened that requires event processing to be
            aborted, the method must return <tt>kfTRUE</tt> to enable processing
            to continue and histogramming of the resulting event array to be
            performed.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The following parameters are passed to <tt>operator()</tt>
    <ol>
        <li><tt>const Address_t pEvent</tt>  This is a pointer to the start of
            the raw event that is being analyzed.
        </li>
        <li><tt>CEvent&amp; rEvent</tt>
            This is a reference to the parameter array that needs to be filled
             in for this event.  <tt>rEvent</tt> is actually an array like
             object that automatically expands to fit the required number
             of parameters.  The SpecTcl <tt>parameter</tt> command defines
             a correspondence between an array index and a SpecTcl named
             parameter.  It is this correspondence that allows SpecTcl
             to drive its histogramming.
        </li>
        <li><tt>CAnalyzer&amp; rAnalyzer</tt>
            This is a reference to the object that directs the main flow
            of event processing.  The services provided by this object
            are defined in <tt>Analyzer.h</tt>  (base class).  When SpecTcl is
            constructed to use the event processing pipeline, the
            actual type of this analyzer is a <tt>CTclAnalyzer</tt>.
            See <a href='#setting_event_size'>Setting the Event Size</a>
            below for more information about why you will need to know this.
        </li>
        <li><tt><a href="decoder.htm">CBufferDecoder</a>&amp; rDecoder</tt>
            Is a reference to the object that has been associated with the data
            source and knows enough about the overall structure of the data
            to be able to tell the analyzer what types of data to process next.
            <tt>BufferDecodeer.h</tt> provides the base class functionality.
            See <a href='#byte_ordering'>Byte Ordering and the Raw Event</a> for
            at least one point in which you will want to interact with this object.
            Specific types of buffer decoders may provide other services.
            Since the buffer decoder is a property of the data source, you should
            never assume you know the actual buffer decoder type but use
            the <b>dynamic_cast</b> operator and catch/test failures in converting
            the buffer decoder reference to a reference/pointer to a specific
            decoder type.
            If you don't know what <b>dynamic_cast</b> does, consult a
            C++ reference.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
</p>


<h4 id='filling_revent'>Decoding the event</h4>
<p>
    Of necessity how you decode an event an how you fill the <tt>rEvent</tt>
    paramter is very application specific.  The <tt>rEvent</tt> object can
    be treated as an array of double precision floats.
    Elements can be assigned to and fetched using normal
    indexing.  Each element also has a method <tt>isValid</tt> that only
    returns true if the element has been assigned a value for this event.
</p>
<p>
    You may always assign an element of <tt>rEvent</tt> a value but if you
    attempt to read a value for which <tt>isValid</tt> would return false,
    a <tt>std::string</tt> exception will be thrown.  The value of this
    exception will be: <tt>Attempted getValue of unset ValidValue object</tt>
</p>

<p>
    The <a href='tree.htm'>tree parameter</a> package allows you impose structure
    on the <tt>rEvent</tt> array.  Most event processors at the NSCL use
    the tree parameter pacakge.
</p>

<h4 id='byte_ordering'>Handling byte order differences</h4>

<p>
    SpecTcl is written to be byte order independent.  Specifically SpecTcl users
    outside the NSCL have ported and run SpecTcl on big-endian systems.
    If this talk of endianess does not mean anything to you see
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness'>this wikipedia article</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Data taken from some data source will have a specific endian-ness that
    my not match the endian-ness of the system SpecTcl is running on. The
    <tt>TranslatorPointer</tt> templated class provides an object that behaves
    like a pointer but transparently swaps bytes for the family of integer types
    if necessary.  This is possible because NSCLDAQ data contains information
    that allows software to determine if the endian-ness of the data and
    the running system are different.
</p>
<p>
    The buffer decoder object <tt>rDecoder</tt> is expected to be able to determine
    and manufacture an appropriate TranslatorPointer for you.  The TranslatorPointer
    class (described in <tt>TranslatorPointer.h</tt>) can also convert between
    pointers for different types.  The translator poniter can only create
    translator pointer for addresses that live within the event currently being
    analyzed.
</p>
<p>
    Here's a code snippet that shows how to create a translator pointer:
    
</p>
<pre>
  TranslatorPointer&lt;UShort_t&gt; p(*(rDecoder.getBufferTranslator()), pEvent);
</pre>


<h4 id='setting_event_size'>Setting the Event Size</h4>
<p>
    At least one element of the event processing pipeline must report the
    event size in bytes.  This is done by converting the analyzer to
    refer to a <tt>CTclAnalyzer</tt> and invoking its
    <tt>SetEventSize</tt> method.
</p>
<p>
    The example in <tt>MySpecTclApp.cpp</tt> is a bit old and a better
    way to perform this operation is shown below.  The method shown assumes
    an event whose first word (16 bits) contains a self inclusive word count.
</p>
<pre>
  TranslatorPointer&lt;UShort_t&gt; p(*(rDecoder.getBufferTranslator()), pEvent);
  
  try {
    CTclAnalyzer&amp;      rAna(dynamic_cast&lt;CTclAnalyzer&amp;&gt;(rAnalyzer));
    UShort_t  nWords = *p++;
    rAna.SetEventSize(nWords*sizeof(UShort_t)); // Set event size.
  }
  catch (bad_cast& error) {
     // Control lands here if the analyzer is not  CTCLAnalyzer.
     // That's probably a severe enough error to report and exit:
     
     std::cerr &lt;&lt; "rAnalyzer is not a CTclAnalyzer!!!&lt;&lt; error.what()
               &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
     
  }
</pre>

<p>
    The services offered both by the base class and a specific buffer decoder
    may be useful to you.  See <a href='decoder.htm'>here</a> for more
    information about those services both for the base class and derived
    classes that are packaged with SpecTcl.
</p>

<h3 id='begin'>OnBegin</h3>
<p>
    This method is called for an event that signals the beginning of a run.
    The method is supposed to return <tt>kfTRUE</tt> on success and is passed
    the following parameters:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><tt>CAnalyzer&amp; rAnalyzer</tt></li>
    <li><tt><a href="decoder.htm">CBufferDecoder</a>&amp; rDecoder</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
    These parameters are described in the section above that describes the
    <a href='#functor'><tt>operator()</tt></a> methods.
</p>


<h3>OnEnd</h3>
<p>
    This method is called for an event that signals the end of a run.
    The parameters are the same as for <a href='#begin'><tt>OnBegin</tt></a>.
</p>

<h3>OnPause</h3>
<p>
    This method is called for an event that signals a pause run.  Note that not
    all data sources can signal this event type.  The parameters for this method
    are the same as for <a href='#begin'><tt>OnBegin</tt></a>.
</p>

<h3>OnResume</h3>
<p>
    This method is called for an event that signals a resume run.  Note that
    not all data sources can signal this event type.
    The parameters for this method
    are the same as for <a href='#begin'><tt>OnBegin</tt></a>.
</p>

<h3>OnOther</h3>
<p>
    This method is called when an event type other than the ones handled by
    the methods previously described.  The parameters passed to this method are:
    
<ol>
    <li><tt>UInt_t type</tt></li>
    <li><tt>CAnalyzer&amp; rAnalyzer</tt></li>
    <li><tt><a href="decoder.htm">CBufferDecoder</a>&amp; rDecoder</tt></li>
</ol>

The <tt>rAnalyzer</tt> and <tt>rDecoder</tt> parameters have been described
previously.  The <tt>type</tt> parameter is the type of the event.  The type of
event may depend on the event source.
    
<h3>OnEventSourceOpen</h3>
<p>
    Called when a new event source is opened.
</p>
<h3>OnEventSourceEOF</h3>
<p>
    Called when an event source hits the end of file.
