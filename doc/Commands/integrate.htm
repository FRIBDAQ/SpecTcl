<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>
<tt>
integrate spectrum area-of-interest
</tt>
</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
  Integrates areas of interest in 1-d and 2-d spectra.
<ul>
  <li><tt>spectrum</tt>  is the name of the spectrum to integrate</li>
  <li><tt>area-of-interest</tt> describes the region of the spectrum to be
      integrated. This can be either the name of a suitable gate that is displayable
      on the <tt>spectrum</tt> or a list of points in parameter coordinates
      that describe the region of integration.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<p>
<tt>integrate</tt> Integrates a spectrum within some selected area of interest.
The command returns the centroid, total number of counts and full width
at &frac12; maximum under gaussian peak shape assumption.
</p>
<p>
The spectrum can be essentially any kind of spectrum, although clearly, some
spectra have integrations that may not be very meaningful (e.g. summary
spectra).  The area of interest can either be a gate name or a list of points
that describe the area of interest.
</p>
<p>
If the area of interest is a gate name it must be the name of gate of suitable
type that can be displayed on the spectrum.  Suitable means that if the
spectrum is 1-d the gate must be a slice, while if the spectrum is 2-d the gate
must be a contour.  Displayable means that if you displayed the spectrum in
Xamine, you would see the gate displayed on that spectrum.  In general, that
means that the parameters that the gate is defined on are the same as the
parameters the spectrum is defined on.
</p>
<p>
If the area of interest is a set of points, for 1-d spectra, the points must be
a Tcl list that is a pair that specifies
the boundaries of the integration region.  The
points must be specified in the coordinate system of the parameter the
spectrum is defined on, rather than in spectrum channels (note that it is
possible, but not necessary, that the spectrum was defined in such a way that
these two coordinate systems are the same.
</p>
<p>
For example; Consider a spectrum defined:
<pre>
spectrum aSpectrum 1 aParameter {{0 1023 512}}
</pre>
The command
<pre>
integrate aSpectrum [list 200 300]
</pre>
Will integrate the spectrum from channels 100 through 150 because the spectrum
is specified as a 2:1 compresssion of the parameter to spectrum channels.
</p>
<p>
If the area of interest is a set of points for a 2-d spectrum, the points must
be a list of coordinate pairs (again in parameter coordinates not channels),
that define the vertices of a closed polyfigure (line crossings are allowed, and there must be
a minimum of three points).  The interior of the polyfigure is defined in the
same way the interior of a contour is defined: For any point, extend a line to
infinity in any direction.  If the line crosses an odd number of line segments
defining the polygon the point is inside otherwise outside.
</p>
<p>
For example:
<pre>
integrate a2dSpectrum [list [list 0 0] [list 100 0] [list 100 100] [list 0 100]]
</pre>
integrates a square that has one vertex at the origin and has a side 100
parameter units.
</p>
<p>
The command returns a Tcl list that contains the integration centroid, the
number of counts in the region of interest, and the Full width at &frac12;
maximum (FWHM) under the assumption the region of interest encloses a single peak
with a gaussian line shape.  If the spectrum is a 2-d spectrum,
The centroid and FWHM are returned as pairs that describe the x and y centroids
or FWHM's in the X and Y directions respectively.
</p>
<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>
The command can error out with the following error messages:
<ul>
  <li>Incorrect parameter count [followed by usage description]</li>
  <li><tt>spectrumname</tt> must be the name of a valid spectrum
      [followed by usage description]</li>
  <li><pre>
1d Spectrum region of interest is invalid
Must be the name of a slice displayable on the spectrum
or a low/high limit pair was:</pre> [actual roi string]
  </li>
  <li><pre>
2d Spectrum region of interest is invalid
Must be the name of a contour that is displayable
on the spectrum or a list of at least 3 coordinates was:</pre> [actual roi string]
  </li>
  <li><pre>
[spectrum-name] is not a spectrum for which we support integration (yet)
please make a note of the type of spectrum this is is and
report this to http://daqbugs.nscl.msu.edu</pre>
  </li>
  <li>No spectrum channels are within the limits</li>
  <li>Integration area is zero</li>
</ul>
