<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p> 
project [-[no]snapshot] sourcespec newspec x|y [contourname]
</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Creates projections of 2d and gamma 2d spectra..</p>
<ul>
      <li>-[no]snapshot controls whether or not the resulting spectrum will be
      incremented as a result of further event analysis.  If -snapshot, the
      spectrum will remain static.  If -nosnapshot or if the switch is omitted,
      SpecTcl will continue to increment the spectrum.  See the Detailed
      Description below for information about conditions and foldings that
      might be applied to the projection.</li>
      <li>sourcespec is the name of a 2-d or gamma 2-d spectrum whose
      projection will be taken.</li>
      <li>newspec is the name of the new spectrum generated by the project
      command.  This spectrum must not exist.</li>
      <li>x|y  The projection direction.  x means that for each x, the
      projection is done by summing channels for that x along the y direction.
      Similarly, y meanns that for each y, the projection is done by summing
      channels for that y along the x direction.</li>
      <li>contourname If present, this is the name of a contour (if 2-d
      spectrum) or gamma contour (if 2-d gamma).  The contour must include all
      parameters in the source spectrum.   Only the region inside the contour
      is projected in the specified direction.</li>	
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<p>Projections create new 1-d or 1-d gamma spectra (called the target spectrum)
      from existing 2-d or 2-d
      gamma spectrum (called the source spectrum)  by taking a projection (possibily limited by a region of
      interest specified by a contour or gamma contour) in either the X or Y
      direction.  There are two specific cases to consider.  
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Projections of ordinary 2-d spectra.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Projection of gamma 2-d spectra.
	</li>
      </ul>
<h3>Projections of ordinary 2-d spectra</h3>
<P>The result of projecting an ordinary 2-d spectrum is an ordinary 1-d
	spectrum.  If the <tt>-snapshot</tt> switch is supplied, this
	spectrum will be frozen. </P>
<P>The target spectrum may automatically have gates applied to it.  
Gates will only be applied to targets that are not snapshot spectra.
The intent of these gates is to ensure that the target spectrum increments in
such a way that it remains a faithful projection of the source spectrum.</P>
<P> Automatic gating is as follows:
<UL>
   <LI>If the source spectrum is ungated, and the projection is not via a
   contour, the target spectrum is gated with a "TRUE" gate (is ungated).</LI>
   <LI>If the source spectrum is gated, and the projection is not via a
   contour, the target spectrum is gated with the same gate as the source
   spectrum.</LI>
   <LI>If the source spectrum is not gated, and the projection is via a
   contour, the projection contour gates the target spectrum.</LI>
   <LI>If the source spectrum is gated, and the projection is via a contour, a
   gate is created that is the AND of these two gates and applied to the target
   spectrum.  This AND gate will be named:
   __PROJECTIONGATE__<em>roi</em>__AND__<em>sourcegate</em>__
   where <em>roi</em> is the projection contour and <em>sourcegate</em> is the
   name of the gate on the source spectrum.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Suppose, for example, we have a spectrum named pid_gamma which is gated on 
 a gamma slice named <em>511kev</em>, and that the X axis of this spectrum is
 an energy, while the Y is e.g. a de.  Suppose this spectrum has a contour
 drawn on it (not applied to it) named 6Li. The command:
<pre>
   project pid_gamma 6Li511kev x 6Li
</pre>
Produces a new spectrum named 6Li511kev which is gated on the and of 6Li and
 511Kev.  The spectrum is initially filled with the projection of
 pid_gamma in the x direction within the region of interest defined by
 the contour 6Li.  The and gate created is named __PROJECTION_6Li__AND__511Kev__
<h3>Projections of gamma 2-d spectra </h3>
<P>The target spectrum of a projection of a 2d gamma spectrum is a 1d gamma
 spectrum.  If the <tt>-snapshot</tt> switch is supplied, the target is frozen.
<P>The target spectrum may have gates and folds automatically applied to it.
These gates and folds, in general, will not result in a continued faithful
 projection as the target spectrum increments, as the increments of gamma
 spectra are correlated within the sets of parameters gates and folds. 
<P>If the source spectrrum has a fold applied to it, the same fold will be
 applied to the target spectrum.  Gates are applied to the target spectrum in
 the same way they are applied to ordinary 2-d projection targets.
